# OmsiLaunch

**OmsiLaunch** is an open-source layer for launching OMSI 2 programmatically,
managing sessions and controlling the running simulation. It plans a session
from a declarative description, applies every temporary configuration change
inside a journalled transaction, starts OMSI, observes it until gameplay, lets
tools read and change the running simulation through a public API, and restores
every file it touched when the session ends.

It is infrastructure for launchers, tools, automation and community
integrations. It is not a graphical launcher.

> **Define the session, not the clicks.**

## Status: 0.1.0-beta3

The current public beta is **`0.1.0-beta3`**. Beta 3 is the post-hardening
baseline. Most of its features are `RUNTIME_VALIDATED`: they were observed in
live OMSI sessions, including the runtime closure round of 2026-09-23. Some
remain `STATICALLY_VALIDATED` (offline tests only), `PARTIAL` or `UNAVAILABLE`.
Two runtime items are still open because they cannot be produced safely: Steam
LAA gameplay and the natural removal of road vehicles and humans (RV-002). The
[runtime validation status](docs/localized/en-GB/status/runtime-validation-status.md) page is
the authoritative record of what ran under OMSI and what ran only offline.

It is a beta: the public API, CLI and file formats are marked `STABLE_BETA`,
`EXPERIMENTAL`, `PARTIAL`, `INTERNAL` or `UNAVAILABLE` per member and may still
change before 1.0.

## Supported OMSI scope

OmsiLaunch supports exactly one OMSI 2 build and refuses to start anything it
does not recognise.

| Item | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| OMSI build | Profile `Omsi23004_692EBFBF`: `Omsi.exe` with SHA-256 `692EBFBF2CD32FAB05A8B934E52C2BE14594E939882F3DBF2BA4E2B66CCC6243` (OMSI 2.3.004). `STABLE_BETA`; every runtime validation ran on this file. |
| Steam LAA executable | SHA-256 `7DAB063D1F62E73B3A2C7A6AC1921D7EDF5E5DB0FBC731481D117EEC8DE7D759` is accepted by allow-list. Only the fingerprint and planning were validated; gameplay was **not** runtime validated. `PARTIAL`. |
| Unknown builds | Rejected with `OL_E_UNSUPPORTED_BUILD`. The hash is re-checked at every plan and at every start. |
| Operating system | Windows 10 or later, x64. |
| Runtimes | .NET 6 Desktop Runtime **x64** (controller) and .NET 6 Runtime **x86** (the plugin runs inside the 32-bit `Omsi.exe`). |

Details: [Compatibility](docs/localized/en-GB/reference/compatibility.md) and
[Installation](docs/localized/en-GB/getting-started/installation.md).

## What it provides

**Sessions.** A session is planned from a `LaunchSpec` (CLI flags, a JSON file,
a Session Profile or the API), validated without side effects (`/plan`), then
started, observed through `SessionState` transitions and ended. Stopping a
session terminates OMSI by force, so OMSI cannot write over the files that are
about to be restored. See [Session lifecycle](docs/localized/en-GB/concepts/session-lifecycle.md).

**Transactions and recovery.** Every configuration override is scoped to the
session. OmsiLaunch snapshots, journals, applies, verifies and restores each
file it changes, including after a crash (`/recovery-status`, `/recover`,
`RecoverPendingAsync`). It offers no permanent configuration editing. See
[Transactions and recovery](docs/localized/en-GB/concepts/transactions-and-recovery.md).

**CLI (`OmsiLaunch.exe`).** A reference frontend over the same public API, with
no OMSI logic of its own: discovery, planning, starting sessions, and client
commands against a running session. See the [CLI reference](docs/localized/en-GB/reference/cli.md)
and [CLI examples](docs/localized/en-GB/reference/cli-examples.md).

**`OmsiLaunchW.exe`.** The Windows-subsystem host for shortcuts. It takes the
same command line with no console window and reports failures in message boxes.
See [OmsiLaunchW.exe](docs/localized/en-GB/reference/omsilaunchw.md).

**Windows tray.** Every owner session shows a notification-area icon with a
status window and an "End session" action. The action takes the same stop path
as `session stop`. See [Windows tray](docs/localized/en-GB/reference/windows-tray.md).

**Session Profiles.** Declarative `profile.yaml` packages
(`omsilaunch.session-profile/v1`) under
`.omsilaunch\session-profiles\<id>\`, so that content authors can ship
reproducible sessions that start with one command. See
[Session Profiles](docs/localized/en-GB/reference/session-profiles.md).

**Public API and runtime control.** `OmsiLaunch.Api` (`IOmsiLaunch`) is the
preferred product surface. Runtime operations such as time, weather, map,
camera, timetable, vehicles, humans, script variables and D3D textures are
session-scoped, validated against the build profile, and addressed through opaque
semantic handles, never native pointers. Results are bounded by a 64 KiB
runtime slot. See the [Public API reference](docs/localized/en-GB/reference/public-api.md) and
[Runtime control](docs/localized/en-GB/reference/runtime-control.md).

**Local control.** A per-installation named pipe bound to the active
`session_id` lets other same-user processes read status and events, stop the
session and run public runtime operations. See
[Local control / IPC](docs/localized/en-GB/reference/local-control.md).

**Capabilities.** Every capability and public runtime operation is catalogued
with its stability. Experimental and unavailable capabilities are listed, not
hidden (`OmsiLaunch.exe capabilities`). See
[Capabilities](docs/localized/en-GB/reference/capabilities.md).

**Permanent plugin.** The in-process plugin closure is installed once under
`plugins\OmsiLaunch.*`. Before every start it is checked against the SHA-256
entries of `release-manifest.json`. Third-party plugins are never touched. See
[Permanent plugin model](docs/localized/en-GB/concepts/permanent-plugin.md).

## Quick start

Extract the release package into the OMSI 2 installation root, then run the
following commands from that directory:

```text
OmsiLaunch.exe /version
OmsiLaunch.exe /list:Maps
OmsiLaunch.exe /new /map:maps\Grundorf\global.cfg /entrypoint-index:1 /plan
OmsiLaunch.exe /new /map:maps\Grundorf\global.cfg /entrypoint-index:1
```

While that session runs, a second console in the same directory can query or
end it:

```text
OmsiLaunch.exe session status --json
OmsiLaunch.exe time get
OmsiLaunch.exe session stop
```

integrators: [Public API quick start](docs/localized/en-GB/getting-started/api-quick-start.md).

## Documentation

The full documentation set is indexed in [`docs/localized/en-GB/README.md`](docs/localized/en-GB/README.md).

### Documentation in other languages

The documentation is translated into 14 locales under
[`docs/localized/`](docs/localized/LOCALIZATION-MANIFEST.md). The translations
were produced from the canonical English (US) pages and validated mechanically
against them. Native-speaker editorial review was not part of the Beta 3 release
and may follow after publication. When a translation and the English page
disagree, the English page is authoritative.

## Limitations and open items

These are the most important limitations. The complete list is in
[Known limitations](docs/localized/en-GB/reference/known-limitations.md).

- **One OMSI build.** Steam LAA is `PARTIAL`: gameplay, reads, commands and stop
  need a genuine Steam installation and were not runtime validated.
- **Not available in this beta:** starting from the last map state (`/last`),
  explicit date, time, year or weather at start, and player-vehicle assignment
  at start. Requesting any of these makes the plan not runnable instead of being
  silently ignored.
- **Runtime writes are limited.** `weather.set`, calendar writes, string-variable
  writes and vehicle relocation are unavailable. Runtime changes are not
  journalled and are not restored.
- **Handle lifetime.** Stale detection for road vehicles and humans that
  disappear naturally (RV-002) has no safe runtime producer and is validated
  offline only.
- **Bounded results.** Long lists are truncated (`truncated=true`). There is no
  paging.
- **Stop is forced.** OMSI's own shutdown does not run, and unsaved OMSI state is
  lost.
- **Same-user trust model.** Any process of the same Windows user can reach the
  local control plane.

## Download

Download **`OmsiLaunch-0.1.0-beta3.zip`** and its `.sha256` file from the
[Releases page](https://github.com/lmonteirotech/OmsiLaunch/releases). Extract
it directly into the supported OMSI root. The package contains the controller
(`OmsiLaunch.exe`, `OmsiLaunchW.exe`), its dependencies, the permanent plugin
closure with `release-manifest.json`, splash assets, a session example and the
offline documentation under `.omsilaunch\docs\`. Package layout and clean
removal: [Packaging](docs/localized/en-GB/reference/packaging.md).

## Building from source

Requirements:

- Windows 10 or later, x64.
- .NET 6 SDK, with the x64 and x86 .NET 6 runtimes for running the tests.
- Visual Studio with the MSBuild C++ workload (platform toolset `v145`) and a
  Windows 10 SDK, for the three native projects: `OmsiLaunch.Native.x86`
  (Win32), and `OmsiLaunch.Bootstrapper` and `OmsiLaunch.WindowsHost` (x64).

`OmsiLaunch.sln` holds the managed projects and test suites. The single
offline entry point builds everything and runs every offline suite; it never
launches OMSI:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\Invoke-OfflineValidation.ps1
```

`-SkipNative` skips the native projects and the packaging regression.
`-SkipDocs` skips the documentation gates. Build output goes to `artifacts\`,
which is not tracked. `tools\New-ReleasePackage.ps1` stages, hashes, validates
and compresses a release package from an existing build. See
[Packaging](docs/localized/en-GB/reference/packaging.md) and
[Testing and validation](TESTING-AND-VALIDATION.md).
