# Implementation Status

Status: RUNTIME_NEW_MAP_PASS (canonical baseline) plus the beta3 hardening
round. Most hardening changes have since run under OMSI in Round A and in the
runtime closure round; this table summarises implementation state, and the
per-item runtime evidence (and what is still offline-only) is authoritative in
[`docs/status/runtime-validation-status.md`](docs/status/runtime-validation-status.md).
A row that still says STATICALLY_VALIDATED here is superseded by that page when
the page lists runtime evidence for it. The detailed documentation is indexed in
[`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md).

| Component | State | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RuntimePlatform abstraction | STATICALLY_VALIDATED | Current Windows x64 provider is implemented. |
| Current Windows x64 provider | STATICALLY_VALIDATED | Validates platform before mutable runtime operations. |
| BuildProfile | STATICALLY_VALIDATED | `Omsi23004_692EBFBF` is fingerprint-scoped. |
| Native.x86 | RUNTIME_VALIDATED | v145 Win32 build; profile/original-byte guards exercised on the canonical path. |
| OmsiHook-derived interop foundation | STATICALLY_VALIDATED | x86 Delphi strings, dynamic arrays, object snapshots and explicit remote-allocation boundary; no upstream RPC protocol. |
| In-process plugin interop | STATICALLY_VALIDATED | `PluginRuntime` uses a profile-scoped in-process memory provider; external attach is not the normal session path. |
| Runtime command channel | STATICALLY_VALIDATED | Session-bound single-flight 64 KiB mailbox (request bound to session id and request id, SHA-256 integrity) dispatched by the OMSI UI-thread timer. Hardening round: a response arriving after the host timeout is detected and discarded instead of wedging the channel as busy; the plugin never publishes a response for an abandoned request; oversized results are `OL_E_RUNTIME_RESPONSE_TOO_LARGE` (`runtime-command.late-response-ignored`). The stale-response path is runtime-validated (Round A RA-019; runtime closure `R03`). |
| Public API boundary | STATICALLY_VALIDATED | `ExecuteRuntimeAsync` validates against `PublicCapabilityRegistry` before session lookup: unknown and `internal.*` operations return `OL_E_RUNTIME_OPERATION_UNKNOWN`, missing arguments `OL_E_RUNTIME_ARGUMENT_REQUIRED`; result keys `internal_*`, `*_address`, `*_pointer`, `*_vmt` are stripped; no `IntPtr`/`nint`/Win32 handle exists in `OmsiLaunch.Api` (`api.runtime-rejects-internal-operations`). |
| Runtime map/weather/camera readers | RUNTIME_VALIDATED | Time, weather, actual weather and camera reads are runtime-validated. `map.read` was revalidated after the `OmsiGlobals.Map` slot correction (session `9dd62626-94c6-4cd7-bb6f-0288327696f4`: `loaded=true`, 19 tiles, coherent Grundorf identity, filename, description and year range) and read on Berlin-Spandau in the documentation capture; see [`docs/status/runtime-validation-status.md`](docs/status/runtime-validation-status.md). |
| Advanced map/tile graph | BLOCKED_PROFILE_LAYOUT | The upstream `OmsiMap.Kacheln` label at `Map+0x118` did not resolve to a valid Delphi dynamic-array header in three guarded Current sessions. The trial never writes and all sessions restored normally. |
| Runtime time/weather writes | PARTIALLY_SUPPORTED | `time.set` applies profiled `SetTime` with read-back. `weather.set` is deliberately rejected: both profiled wind-write candidates are overwritten on the next normal OMSI weather tick, so a native weather-apply lifecycle is required before public mutation. |
| Runtime camera FOV write | RUNTIME_VALIDATED | `camera.set` changed and restored FOV during the canonical session; camera family remains range-guarded. |
| Runtime camera lock | RUNTIME_VALIDATED | `camera.lock`/`camera.unlock` are session-scoped. The policy reapplies a camera family and optional driver/passenger preset without changing head-look or FOV. Runtime closure `CAM01` (session `5dfd9b96-fa94-4060-85af-0c9d19823a73`, saved situation with a PlayerVehicle): families 0, 2 and 1 confirmed by read-back, unlock released the policy. The registry's `RuntimeValidation` string still reads `STATICALLY_VALIDATED` (self-report lag). |
| Runtime vehicle/human/timetable summary | RUNTIME_VALIDATED | Canonical Grundorf batch returned road vehicle state, human count, and timetable manager array counts without exposing raw pointers. |
| Runtime detailed timetable telemetry | RUNTIME_VALIDATED | Profiled immutable snapshots returned tracks, trips and lines with their semantic names, paths, counts and assignment metadata through the session channel. |
| Runtime timetable stops and links | RUNTIME_VALIDATED | Profiled immutable snapshots returned bus-stop names, IDs, links and station-link endpoint metadata. `Nordspitze` was read live from the UTF-16 Delphi field. |
| Runtime timetable tours | RUNTIME_VALIDATED | Profiled nested Tour snapshots returned line affiliation, AI group/type, vehicle reservation metadata and TourEntry counts without exposing Delphi pointers. |
| Runtime timetable profiles | RUNTIME_VALIDATED | Profiled nested Profile snapshots returned trip affiliation, name, total time, stop-time and track-entry-time counts. |
| Runtime timetable tour entries | RUNTIME_VALIDATED | Profiled nested TourEntry snapshots returned semantic trip identity, trip/profile indices, timing and smooth-transition state. |
| Runtime timetable track entries | RUNTIME_VALIDATED | Bounded TrackEntry snapshots returned 91 live records with track affiliation, ID, tile/path, distances, validity, ordering and chrono metadata through the session channel. |
| Runtime timetable RVFiles | RUNTIME_VALIDATED | Profiled RVFile array returned a valid empty collection on Grundorf through the session channel. |
| Runtime timetable NoRVNumbers | UNRESOLVED | Upstream `raw:true` decoding conflicts with the observed `Omsi23004_692EBFBF` field layout. Removed from the automatic batch; it does not affect other timetable telemetry. |
| Runtime vehicle/human detailed telemetry | RUNTIME_VALIDATED | Session-scoped opaque handles and read-only snapshots returned coherent vehicle movement/controls/lighting/AI and human target/ticket/seat/station/AI state on Grundorf. No spatial or arbitrary entity writes are enabled. |
| Runtime script variable read | RUNTIME_VALIDATED | ANSI name tables and the instance `PublicVars` pointer array resolved 1,025 names and `Refresh_Strings=0` through an opaque vehicle handle. |
| Runtime script variable mutation | RUNTIME_VALIDATED | `vehicle.variable.set` resolves a live opaque handle and the profiled `PublicVars` slot by open string name, rejects non-finite values, and returns immediate read-back. `Refresh_Strings 0 -> 1 -> 0` passed with normal cleanup. |
| Runtime string-variable read | RUNTIME_VALIDATED | ANSI name tables plus Unicode string values resolved 27 names and `ident=GRN-V 30` through an opaque vehicle handle. Delphi replacement/refcount writes remain separate. |
| Wave A runtime metadata readers | RUNTIME_VALIDATED | HOF metadata, drivers, ticket packs and timetable logs passed in session `e33aae7e-450a-4c00-8c7a-5f550ac4263f`; constants and curves passed in `46260d64-a8e9-4ee9-a907-00e46b07a1ae`, all with normal cleanup. |
| Permanent plugin installation | STATICALLY_VALIDATED | The Release ZIP places the 9-file OmsiLaunch plugin closure directly in `plugins\\OmsiLaunch.*`. Before every start the host validates each installed file's SHA-256 against `release-manifest.json` beside `OmsiLaunch.exe` when present (`plugin.integrity.reference = manifest`; errors `OL_E_PERMANENT_PLUGIN_HASH_MISMATCH`, `OL_E_PERMANENT_PLUGIN_MANIFEST_INCOMPLETE`, `OL_E_PERMANENT_PLUGIN_MISSING`); without a manifest it can only check presence and self-consistency (`self`). A session never stages, snapshots, restores, removes, or claims plugin files, and never touches third-party plugins (`runtime.permanent-plugin-manifest-integrity`). Manifest validation against a packaged install is runtime-validated (Round A; runtime closure `R01`/`R02` on installed release packages). |
| PlaceRandomBus | RUNTIME_VALIDATED | Session `4e2321d4-4c09-428b-8760-d348205b7392` returned `2`, increased RoadVehicles from 2 to 4, then completed exact cleanup. It is distinct from make-basic and makes no PlayerVehicle claim. |
| Public RoadVehicle spawn | RUNTIME_VALIDATED | `road-vehicles.spawn` exposes the proven MakeVehicle basic primitive through canonical `.bus` identity and opaque handle only. The repaired concurrent control plane kept status available while native spawn completed; live count changed `2 -> 3` and `rv-000003` remained resolvable. It makes no PlayerVehicle assignment claim. |
| Named triggers and string mutation | BLOCKED_STRING_OWNERSHIP | Production dispatch is intentionally withheld until Delphi-string allocation, assignment and lifetime can be closed without inheriting upstream leak/corruption risk. |
| OmsiHook domain operation catalog | STATICALLY_VALIDATED | Program, map, time, weather, vehicles, humans, timetable, camera, player and sound domains are semantic/profile-gated. |
| Wave D D3D device and textures | RUNTIME_VALIDATED | Exact-profile device acquisition, one owned QI reference, opaque session handles, create/describe/full and rect update/release, repeated release rejection, multiple resources, forced exit and relaunch cleanup passed. |
| Wave D D3D lifecycle/reset | RUNTIME_VALIDATED (resetting/restored); `lost` offline only | Reset interception invalidates default-pool resources before the native call, advances generation and publishes ordered lifecycle transitions. Runtime closure `D01` (session `fc07946e-58dd-4ddc-af7e-10c7e61a899a`): a test-only display-mode change made OMSI reset its device twice; `d3d.resetting`/`d3d.restored` were emitted, the generation advanced each cycle, a request during the reset got `OL_E_D3D_RESET_IN_PROGRESS`, the pre-reset texture was rejected as stale and new textures worked. OMSI went straight to `DEVICENOTRESET`, so a distinct `lost` transition was not produced. `GetCapabilitiesAsync` still self-reports `IMPLEMENTED_NOT_RUNTIME_VALIDATED`. |
| DNNE adapter | STATICALLY_VALIDATED | Current adapter is separated from PluginRuntime. |
| PluginRuntime | RUNTIME_VALIDATED | Handoff consumption, synchronous headless arm and generic NEW_MAP execution reached gameplay. |
| Portable handoff | STATICALLY_VALIDATED | Fixed-width UTF-8/SHA-256 protocol v4 carries semantic entrypoint and saved-situation identities; v3 decode remains supported and round-trip/corruption tests pass. |
| Content discovery | STATICALLY_VALIDATED | Offline map/situation/vehicle/repaint/HOF discovery plus opaque hashed `[entrypoints]` records; entrypoint launch correlation remains separately gated. |
| Configuration | STATICALLY_VALIDATED | Session-scoped only; lossless no-op, negative flags, ranges, compound blocks, and vector preservation tests pass. |
| `.omsilaunch` installation directory | RELEASE_VALIDATED | Directory state is created lazily after lease acquisition for managed presentation. Persistent resources live under `assets`; diagnostics persist; the durable journal is removed after restore. It is not a file and never a plugin deployment destination. |
| Beta3 session profiles | RUNTIME_VALIDATED | Strict YAML package loading under `.omsilaunch\\session-profiles\\<id>`, 1..5 indexed presets, confined assets, profile provenance diagnostics, field-specific override rejection and session-scoped environment overlays. Fixture `beta3-grundorf-fixture` reached `gameplay.entered`, observed eight seconds, restored `options.cfg`, removed its journal/lease and left the source package unmodified. Hardening round (offline): 256 KiB limit, no YAML anchors, and rejection of asset paths that escape through a junction or symlink (`session-profiles.reparse-point-rejected`). |
| Content discovery hardening | STATICALLY_VALIDATED | Discovery skips reparse points so junction cycles cannot hang `/list` or planning; OMSI files are read as Windows-1252 with BOM-marked UTF-8/UTF-16 respected; `options.cfg` patches preserve CP1252 bytes (`content.discovery-junction-cycle`, `content.readlines-cp1252`, `options.cp1252-roundtrip`). |
| OmsiLaunchW, tray and `/silent` | STATICALLY_VALIDATED | `OmsiLaunchW.exe` is a Windows-subsystem bootstrapper over the same `OmsiLaunch.Controller.dll` (sets `OMSILAUNCH_WINDOWS_HOST=1`, console output suppressed, failures and shim exit codes 100 to 106 shown as message boxes). `/silent` re-launches `OmsiLaunchW.exe` with the same arguments and returns 0 once the host started without waiting for the session. The tray indicator offers read-only Status and End session (canonical stop); `SuppressTrayIcon` is API-only. Runtime closure `T01`..`T04`: tray icon, status window, End session with confirmation and Cancel, Explorer restart, windows open during a stop, `/silent` detach and the failure dialogs were observed in real sessions; a non-runnable launch under `OmsiLaunchW.exe` now shows a dialog (documentation audit BUG-06). The shim dialogs `100`..`106` remain offline-only. Reference: [`docs/reference/omsilaunchw.md`](docs/reference/omsilaunchw.md). |
| Managed splash presentation | RELEASE_RUNTIME_VALIDATED | `Managed` is the default. Packaged PTB/ENG/DEU/FRA 640x480 24-bit assets live under `.omsilaunch/assets/splash` and transactionally overlay `GUI/NewSplashscreen_ENG.bmp` plus the resolved locale. Release sessions `388cf5d2-7310-4301-9313-e62c4c08a346` (default) and `794cae34-a2ac-4fcf-8981-f142ac14c308` (custom directory) reached gameplay and completed normal cleanup. `Unset` session `12a74b24-6c78-4863-8ffe-947651212eeb` reached gameplay with no planned GUI overlay. All three restored the original GUI state and removed the journal; permanent product plugins were not transaction participants. |
| Release package | RELEASE_VALIDATED | `tools/New-ReleasePackage.ps1 -Configuration Release` produces `OmsiLaunch-current.zip` with SHA-256 manifest, Release runtime closure, splash assets, `.omsilaunch` example, and no Debug paths in its manifest. |
| Transaction/recovery | RUNTIME_RECOVERY_VALIDATED (pre-hardening) / STATICALLY_VALIDATED (hardening changes) | A stale `HANDOFF_CREATED` journal restored only session-owned artifacts and removed its journal (runtime). Hardening round, offline only: a session-deletion path (ITX targets, `Texture\standard.ipr`, `closecheck`) created during a session is removed at restore when the journal reached `ProcessStarted` and recorded as `restore.session-artifact-removed`, otherwise retained with `OL_W_RESTORE_FOREIGN_FILE_RETAINED`; originally-absent overlays are removed only when their content still matches (`OL_E_RECOVERY_ABSENT_OWNERSHIP_MISMATCH`); recovery runs before the live installation is read on every start; restore verifies each backup against its snapshot SHA-256 (`OL_E_RECOVERY_BACKUP_CORRUPT`) and restores bytes, last-write time, creation time and attributes, handles read-only originals, and removes `backup\<session>` afterwards; a journal past `HandoffCreated` without a PID is `OL_E_INSTALLATION_BUSY` while any `Omsi.exe` from that root runs. Public `RecoverPendingAsync` takes the installation lease. Runtime evidence for these paths (Round A S-01 artifact restore, runtime closure `F01` failed-restore replay, `S04` recovery under the lease and in the pre-PID window, `S05` early recovery before overlay build, `SF01`/`SF02` startup failures) is listed in [`docs/status/runtime-validation-status.md`](docs/status/runtime-validation-status.md). |
| `session.stop` semantics | RUNTIME_VALIDATED (behaviour) / documented this round | Every stop path (`session.stop`, tray End session, Ctrl+C, console close, `CloseAsync`, `/observe-seconds`) requests the canonical stop; the supervisor then calls `TerminateProcess` on OMSI. OMSI's shutdown routine does not run and OMSI does not rewrite `options.cfg`; the `closecheck` it leaves is removed at restore. Cooperative `WM_CLOSE` shutdown is not implemented (backlog). `ShutdownTimeoutSeconds` is carried but not consumed. |
| Local control plane | STATICALLY_VALIDATED | One named pipe per installation, `OmsiLaunch.Control.0.1.<first 16 hex of sha256(root)>`, `CurrentUserOnly`, length-prefixed JSON up to 64 KiB, protocol `0.1`. `session.stop` and `runtime.execute` require the active `session_id`; handler faults are typed (`OL_E_CONTROL_HANDLER_FAILED` or the `OL_E_` code), `OL_E_CONTROL_MESSAGE_TOO_LARGE`, `OL_E_CONTROL_PROTOCOL`. Any process of the same Windows user may connect (accepted risk). `control-plane.binding-and-typed-errors`; runtime evidence RV-003, Round A RA-008 and the runtime closure raw-frame battery `R04`. |
| Diagnostics retention | STATICALLY_VALIDATED | `<root>\.omsilaunch\diagnostics\<sessionId>-host.log` plus `-runtime-*.json`; the 50 newest sessions are kept and older session-prefixed files are deleted when a new session starts; `tray-host.log` and non-session files are never pruned (`diagnostics.retention`). No data leaves the machine. |
| Error catalog | STATICALLY_VALIDATED | `PublicErrorCodes.All` is the single catalog; the documentation gate fails when an `OL_E_*` / `OL_W_*` literal in `src\` or `tools\OmsiLaunch.Cli\` is missing from it or from `docs/reference/errors.md`. |
| Documentation gate | STATICALLY_VALIDATED | `tests\OmsiLaunch.DocumentationTests` compares `docs/` with `CliInput`, `PublicCapabilityRegistry`, `PublicErrorCodes`, `PublicExitCode`, `IOmsiLaunch`, `LaunchSpec` and `SessionProfileCompiler.SchemaKeys`, and resolves every relative link; run by `tools\Invoke-OfflineValidation.ps1`. |
| PlanSession | STATICALLY_VALIDATED | Canonical Grundorf plan resolves runtime artifacts read-only. |
| Headless Start | IMPLEMENTED / RUNTIME_VALIDATED | Native startup was armed synchronously and gameplay was the observed target state. |
| NEW_MAP | IMPLEMENTED / RUNTIME_VALIDATED | Grundorf, presented index 1 and Nordspitze Bauernhof completed through gameplay. |
| NEW_MAP entrypoint identity | RUNTIME_PARTIAL | Offline raw records have stable hashes. Runtime confirms Grundorf presented index `1` selects raw index `0` (`Nordspitze Bauernhof`), but native presented text/mapping remains unresolved. Public identity requests remain gated. |
| SAVED_SITUATION | RUNTIME_VALIDATED | `situations\\Baustelle Falkenseer Ch..osn` loaded Berlin-Spandau through the full profiled Start-form radio, selector, synchronization, and `Button1Click` sequence, reached gameplay, remained RUNNING for 8 seconds, then completed requested stop and normal restore. PlanSession still rejects `.osn` files whose declared map is absent before staging. |
| LAST_MAP_STATE | UNSUPPORTED_FOR_CURRENT_PROFILE | Exact native last-map restoration branch is not closed; no file-order fallback exists. |
| Explicit/system date-time | STATICALLY_PARTIAL | Not requested by canonical regression. |
| Player vehicle | STATICALLY_PARTIAL | Not requested by canonical regression. |
| Legacy NT6 implementation | FUTURE / N/A | Architectural boundary only. |
| Legacy XP implementation | FUTURE / N/A | Architectural boundary only. |

## Canonical Runtime Baseline

`RUNTIME_NEW_MAP_PASS`: public `StartSessionAsync` validated the permanent runtime installation and
portable handoff, reached `gameplay.entered` for `maps\Grundorf\global.cfg`
with presented entrypoint index `1` (`Nordspitze Bauernhof`), remained RUNNING
for eight seconds, then completed a requested stop and normal exact restore.

The Current installation lease uses a named Windows semaphore (maximum count
one), not a mutex: cleanup can occur on a different managed thread. The durable
journal and process identity remain the crash-recovery authority.

The default startup timeout is 180 seconds. This preserves a bounded failure
path while allowing native saved situations on large maps to complete their
legitimate pre-game loading work; callers can set a shorter explicit timeout.

## Release Presentation 001

Release build, unit/integration suites, packaged CLI `PlanSession`, package
manifest and resource validation passed. The packaged executable reports
product `OmsiLaunch`, product version `0.1.0`, protocol `0.1`, and uses the
official multi-resolution icon. A managed Release start created and hash-matched
all four persistent splash assets at `.omsilaunch/assets/splash`. The Release
default, custom and `Unset` sessions each reached gameplay then `Completed`.
Default/custom overlays and native preservation were selected by their public
LaunchSpec and validated by the emitted plans. All three restored the original
GUI state, removed the journal and retained the permanent product plugin
closure. The
absent-destination transaction behavior is separately covered by
`transaction.absent-overlay-restore`.
