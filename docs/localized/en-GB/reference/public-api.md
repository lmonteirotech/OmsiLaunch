# Public API reference (`OmsiLaunch.Api`)

<!-- l10n: source=reference/public-api.md -->
> British English edition of the [canonical page](../../../reference/public-api.md) for OmsiLaunch 0.1.0-beta3. The US English page is normative: where the two differ, it and the code take precedence.

This page is the normative reference for the managed public API of OmsiLaunch 0.1.0-beta3: the `OmsiLaunch.Api` assembly (contracts) and the integrator entry point `OmsiLaunchService` in `OmsiLaunch.Core`. It documents only what the current code does. Everything an integrator can call, receive, or observe is listed here with its stability level; anything not listed is not an integration surface.

The generated [public API inventory](public-api-inventory.md) lists every public type and member of `OmsiLaunch.Api`, `OmsiLaunch.Core` and `OmsiLaunch.Process` with its signature and stability; a documentation gate fails when the inventory and the assemblies differ. This page explains the semantics.

Related pages: [LaunchSpec reference](launchspec.md), [error codes](errors.md), [session lifecycle](../concepts/session-lifecycle.md), [transactions and recovery](../concepts/transactions-and-recovery.md), [runtime control](runtime-control.md), [capabilities](capabilities.md), [local control plane](local-control.md), [exit codes](exit-codes.md), [runtime validation status](../status/runtime-validation-status.md).

## Stability vocabulary

| Level | Meaning on this page |
| --- | --- |
| `STABLE_BETA` | Contract is frozen for the 0.1 protocol line and the path is runtime validated in `research/reports/OMSILAUNCH-RUNTIME-VALIDATION-MATRIX.md`. |
| `EXPERIMENTAL` | Callable and tested, but the contract or the runtime evidence may change before it becomes stable. |
| `PARTIAL` | Present in the contract; only part of the behaviour is implemented or validated (the text says which part). |
| `INTERNAL` | Public in the assembly for technical reasons (the bridge shares the type) but not an integration surface; may change without notice. |
| `UNAVAILABLE` | Present in the contract but rejected by the current build. |

## Assembly overview

| Assembly | Role for integrators |
| --- | --- |
| `OmsiLaunch.Api` | Pure contracts: records, enums, `IOmsiLaunch`, capability registry, error catalogue, wire formats, D3D helpers. Contains no `IntPtr`, `nint`, Win32 handle, native address or process object. |
| `OmsiLaunch.Core` | `OmsiLaunchService` (the `IOmsiLaunch` implementation), `OmsiLaunchRuntimePaths`, `SessionPlanner`, `LaunchValidation`, `SessionProfileCompiler`. |
| `OmsiLaunch.Process` | `IRuntimePlatform` and `CurrentWindowsX64Platform` (the only platform adapter), `InstallationLease`. Needed to construct the service. |
| `OmsiLaunch.Configuration`, `OmsiLaunch.Content`, `OmsiLaunch.Interop`, `OmsiLaunch.Plugin`, `OmsiLaunch.Builds.Omsi23004` | Implementation assemblies. Their public types are `INTERNAL` for integrators. |

## Entry point: `OmsiLaunchService` and `OmsiLaunchRuntimePaths`

```csharp
public sealed record OmsiLaunchRuntimePaths(string PluginBuildDirectory, string NativeBridgePath, string? ReleaseManifestPath = null);
public sealed class OmsiLaunchService : IOmsiLaunch
{
    public OmsiLaunchService(IRuntimePlatform platform, OmsiLaunchRuntimePaths runtimePaths);
}
```

| Parameter | Valid value | Invalid / default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `platform` | `new CurrentWindowsX64Platform()` (namespace `OmsiLaunch.Process`). It detects the platform, creates the OMSI process with `CreateProcessW`, waits on and terminates it. | No other implementation ships. A custom `IRuntimePlatform` is `INTERNAL`. |
| `PluginBuildDirectory` | Directory that contains the permanent plugin closure reference files: `OmsiLaunch.Plugin.opl`, `OmsiLaunch.PluginNE.dll`, `OmsiLaunch.Plugin.deps.json`, `OmsiLaunch.Plugin.runtimeconfig.json` and every `OmsiLaunch.*.dll` of the managed closure (must include `OmsiLaunch.Plugin.dll`). In an installed package this is `<package>\plugins`. | Missing directory or file: `PlanSessionAsync` returns a non-runnable plan with `OL_E_RUNTIME_ARTIFACT_MISSING`. |
| `NativeBridgePath` | Path of `OmsiLaunch.Native.x86.dll` (in the package: `<package>\plugins\OmsiLaunch.Native.x86.dll`). | Same as above. |
| `ReleaseManifestPath` | `release-manifest.json` beside `OmsiLaunch.exe` when present. Supplies the expected SHA-256 of each `plugins/` file (`plugin.integrity.reference = manifest`). | `null` (development layout): the installed files are only checked for presence and self-consistency against the reference closure (`plugin.integrity.reference = self`). Malformed manifest: `OL_E_RELEASE_MANIFEST_INVALID`. |

The service reads these paths on every `PlanSessionAsync` and `StartSessionAsync`; it never copies, stages or removes plugin files (see [permanent plugin](../concepts/permanent-plugin.md)). The CLI constructs the service exactly like this (`tools/OmsiLaunch.Cli/Program.cs`):

```csharp
using OmsiLaunch.Api;
using OmsiLaunch.Core;
using OmsiLaunch.Process;

var package = AppContext.BaseDirectory;                       // directory that contains OmsiLaunch.exe
var plugins = Path.Combine(package, "plugins");
var manifest = Path.Combine(package, "release-manifest.json");
IOmsiLaunch launch = new OmsiLaunchService(
    new CurrentWindowsX64Platform(),
    new OmsiLaunchRuntimePaths(plugins, Path.Combine(plugins, "OmsiLaunch.Native.x86.dll"), File.Exists(manifest) ? manifest : null));
```

Create one service per process and share it. Stability: `STABLE_BETA`.

## Session ownership rules

| Rule | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| One owner per installation | `StartSessionAsync` acquires the installation lease, a named semaphore `Local\OmsiLaunch.Installation.<SHA-256 of the upper-cased full root path>`, and holds it until the supervisor has restored the installation. A second start on the same root from any process of the same logon session fails with `OL_E_INSTALLATION_BUSY` (reported as a `Failed` session, see `StartSessionAsync`). The lease is per logon session, not cross-logon, and is not released while another process holds a handle to it (accepted risk). |
| Handles are process-local | `SessionHandle` wraps the session `Guid`. It is only meaningful to the `OmsiLaunchService` instance that returned it. A handle built from a known `Guid` in another process (or another service instance) yields `KeyNotFoundException`. Cross-process control goes through the [local control plane](local-control.md), not through handles. |
| Always call `CloseAsync` | From `StartSessionAsync` onwards the process owns a durable transaction. `CloseAsync` requests the canonical stop when needed, waits for the supervisor (process exit, exact restore, lease release) and forgets the session. It must be called on every exit path, including after a `Failed` state. Without it the session entry stays in memory; the restore itself is performed by the supervisor regardless. |
| Failed sessions are still sessions | A start that fails after `StartSessionAsync` returned reports `SessionState.Failed`; the handle stays valid for `GetStatusAsync`/`WaitForAsync` until `CloseAsync`. |
| Plans are re-checked | `StartSessionAsync` re-hashes `Omsi.exe` and re-plans the spec; a plan that is no longer runnable is rejected with `OL_E_PLAN_NOT_RUNNABLE`. |

## `IOmsiLaunch`

```csharp
public interface IOmsiLaunch
{
    Task<SessionPlan> PlanSessionAsync(LaunchSpec spec, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    Task<SessionHandle> StartSessionAsync(SessionPlan plan, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    Task<SessionStatus> GetStatusAsync(SessionHandle session, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    Task<SessionStatus> WaitForAsync(SessionHandle session, SessionState state, TimeSpan timeout, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    Task StopAsync(SessionHandle session, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    Task CloseAsync(SessionHandle session, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    Task<RuntimeCommandResult> ExecuteRuntimeAsync(SessionHandle session, RuntimeCommand command, TimeSpan timeout, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    Task<IReadOnlyList<Capability>> GetCapabilitiesAsync(InstallationSpec installation, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    Task<IReadOnlyList<ContentIdentity>> DiscoverAsync(InstallationSpec installation, ContentQueryKind query, OptionalValue<string> scope = default, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    Task<RecoveryStatus> RecoverPendingAsync(InstallationSpec installation, bool restore, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
}
```

Common facts for every method:

- Unknown or already closed handles throw `KeyNotFoundException` ("Unknown OmsiLaunch session.").
- No method requires a Running session except `ExecuteRuntimeAsync`.
- Exceptions that carry an OmsiLaunch code put the code at the start of `Exception.Message` (`"OL_E_PLAN_NOT_RUNNABLE: ..."`). The CLI extracts codes from messages the same way (`CliProgram.Classify`).
- Supported build: only `Omsi23004_692EBFBF` (plus the Steam LAA allow-list hash, accepted; gameplay not validated, it needs a genuine Steam installation). See [compatibility](compatibility.md).

### Complete minimal example

```csharp
var none = new Dictionary<string, OptionalValue<string>>();
var spec = new LaunchSpec(
    Installation: new InstallationSpec(@"C:\OMSI 2"),
    World: new WorldSpec(WorldMode.NewMap, OptionalValue<string>.Set(@"maps\Grundorf\global.cfg"), OptionalValue<string>.Unset, OptionalValue<int>.Set(1)),
    Date: new DateSpec(DateTimeMode.Unset, OptionalValue<SemanticDate>.Unset),

    Behavior: new LaunchBehaviorSpec());

var plan = await launch.PlanSessionAsync(spec);
if (!plan.IsRunnable) { foreach (var d in plan.Diagnostics) Console.WriteLine($"{d.Code}: {d.Message}"); return; }

var session = await launch.StartSessionAsync(plan);
try
{
    var status = await launch.WaitForAsync(session, SessionState.Running, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(plan.Spec.Behavior.StartupTimeoutSeconds + 5));
    if (status.State == SessionState.Running)
    {
        var time = await launch.ExecuteRuntimeAsync(session, new RuntimeCommand(session.SessionId, 1, "time.read"), TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));
        Console.WriteLine(time.Succeeded ? $"{time.Values!["hour"]}:{time.Values["minute"]}" : time.ErrorCode);
        await launch.StopAsync(session);
    }
    var final = await launch.WaitForAsync(session, SessionState.Completed, Timeout.InfiniteTimeSpan);
    Console.WriteLine(final.State);                      // Completed, or Failed with diagnostics
}
finally
{
    await launch.CloseAsync(session);                    // always
}
```

### `PlanSessionAsync`

| Aspect | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Signature | `Task<SessionPlan> PlanSessionAsync(LaunchSpec spec, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)` |
| Purpose | Compile a `LaunchSpec` into a `SessionPlan` without starting OMSI: validate the spec, detect the platform, fingerprint `Omsi.exe`, resolve content identities, compute planned file mutations, list required and unsupported capabilities, and decide `IsRunnable`. Public capability `session.plan`. |
| Parameters | `spec`: a fully populated `LaunchSpec` (see [LaunchSpec reference](launchspec.md)). `Installation`, `World`, `Date`, `Time`, `Environment` (all eight dictionaries) and `Behavior` must be non-null; the optional members may be `null`. `RootPath` should be an absolute directory; an empty root is recorded as `OL_E_INSTALLATION_NOT_FOUND` but the platform probe on an empty path throws `ArgumentException` before the plan is returned, so never pass an empty root. |
| Returns | `SessionPlan` with a fresh `SessionId`, `BuildProfileId = "Omsi23004_692EBFBF"` (always this constant, even when the executable does not match), the input `Spec`, `Platform`, `ResolvedContent`, `TouchedFiles`, `RuntimeArtifacts` (`plugins\OmsiLaunch.*` destination paths plus `"OmsiLaunch startup handoff v4"`), `RequiredCapabilities`, `UnsupportedRequestedFeatures`, `PlannedMutations`, `Diagnostics`, `IsRunnable`. `IsRunnable` is `true` exactly when no diagnostic code starts with `OL_E_`. Informational diagnostics (`plugin.integrity.reference` with message `self` or `manifest`, `session_profile.selected`) never make a plan non-runnable. |
| Result-carried errors | Every planning error is a diagnostic, not an exception: `OL_E_INSTALLATION_NOT_FOUND`, `OL_E_INSTALLATION_NOT_WRITABLE`, `OL_E_UNSUPPORTED_OPERATING_SYSTEM`, `OL_E_UNSUPPORTED_BUILD`, `OL_E_MAP_NOT_FOUND`, `OL_E_ENTRYPOINT_NOT_FOUND`, `OL_E_ENTRYPOINT_REQUIRED`, `OL_E_SITUATION_NOT_FOUND`, `OL_E_SITUATION_MAP_NOT_FOUND`, `OL_E_VEHICLE_NOT_FOUND`, `OL_E_REPAINT_NOT_FOUND`, `OL_E_HOF_NOT_FOUND`, `OL_E_DATE_TIME_APPLY_FAILED`, `OL_E_INVALID_ARGUMENT`, `OL_E_CAPABILITY_UNAVAILABLE`, `OL_E_UNKNOWN_SETTING`, `OL_E_SETTING_NOT_WRITABLE`, `OL_E_SESSION_PRESENTATION_INVALID` (message carries the splash/ITX code), `OL_E_PERMANENT_PLUGIN_MISSING`, `OL_E_PERMANENT_PLUGIN_HASH_MISMATCH`, `OL_E_PERMANENT_PLUGIN_MANIFEST_INCOMPLETE` (the installed plugin closure in `plugins\` is verified against the release manifest at planning time), `OL_E_RUNTIME_ARTIFACT_MISSING` (message may carry `OL_E_RELEASE_MANIFEST_INVALID`). Full conditions: [LaunchSpec validation rules](launchspec.md#validation-rules-and-non-runnable-diagnostics). |
| Thrown | `OperationCanceledException` if the token is already cancelled at entry (the only checkpoint); `ArgumentException`/`NotSupportedException` for syntactically invalid root paths; `NullReferenceException`/`ArgumentNullException` for null required members; `System.Text.Json.JsonException` for a syntactically invalid release manifest. |
| Cancellation | Checked once at entry. Planning is synchronous file-system work afterwards. |
| Running session required | No. |
| Mutates OMSI state | No. |
| Mutates the file system | No (reads `Omsi.exe`, content files, plugin closure, manifest). Setting values are not validated here (only key existence and writability); an invalid value fails at start with `OL_E_INVALID_SETTING_VALUE`. |
| Transaction / restore | None. |
| Limitations | Requesting any of `Date`/`Time`/`Year` mode other than `Unset`, any `Weather` mode other than `Unset`, any `PlayerVehicle` field, `Input` documents, `EntrypointIdentity`, or `WorldMode.LastMapState` produces `OL_E_CAPABILITY_UNAVAILABLE` and a non-runnable plan on this build (`STATICALLY_PARTIAL` / `UNSUPPORTED_FOR_CURRENT_PROFILE` entries in `UnsupportedRequestedFeatures`). |
| Stability | `STABLE_BETA`. |
| Example | `var plan = await launch.PlanSessionAsync(spec); Console.WriteLine(plan.IsRunnable ? "READY" : string.Join(", ", plan.Diagnostics.Where(d => d.Code.StartsWith("OL_E_")).Select(d => d.Code)));` |

### `StartSessionAsync`

| Aspect | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Signature | `Task<SessionHandle> StartSessionAsync(SessionPlan plan, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)` |
| Purpose | Start a transactional managed OMSI session from a runnable plan: acquire the installation lease, recover a stale journal, validate the permanent plugin closure, snapshot and overlay session files, create the startup handoff, telemetry slot and runtime mailbox, start `Omsi.exe`, record the process in the journal, and hand the session to a background supervisor. Public capability `session.start`. |
| Parameters | `plan`: a `SessionPlan` with `IsRunnable == true`. The spec inside the plan is re-planned; only `plan.SessionId` is kept from the caller's plan. `plan.Spec.Behavior.StartupTimeoutSeconds` must be 1..600. |
| Returns | `SessionHandle(plan.SessionId)` as soon as `Omsi.exe` has been created and recorded (state `WaitingForPlugin`), or as soon as the start path failed (state `Failed`). It does not wait for gameplay; use `WaitForAsync(session, SessionState.Running, ...)`. |
| Thrown | `InvalidOperationException("OL_E_PLAN_NOT_RUNNABLE")` when `plan.IsRunnable` is false; `InvalidOperationException("OL_E_PLAN_NOT_RUNNABLE: <codes>")` when the re-plan is not runnable (for example `Omsi.exe` changed, content removed, plugin closure missing); `InvalidOperationException("Duplicate session id.")` when a session with the same id is still registered (call `CloseAsync` first); `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` when `StartupTimeoutSeconds` is outside 1..600; `OperationCanceledException` when cancelled before or during the re-plan; plus everything `PlanSessionAsync` throws. In all thrown cases no session is registered. |
| Result-carried errors | Any failure after the re-plan is caught inside the start path: the session is registered, its state is `Failed`, and its diagnostics contain `OL_E_START_SESSION` whose message is the inner message (starting with the inner code when there is one): `OL_E_INSTALLATION_BUSY` (lease held or a journalled OMSI process still alive), `OL_E_PERMANENT_PLUGIN_MISSING`, `OL_E_PERMANENT_PLUGIN_MANIFEST_INCOMPLETE`, `OL_E_PERMANENT_PLUGIN_HASH_MISMATCH`, `OL_E_RELEASE_MANIFEST_INVALID`, `OL_E_SPLASH_ASSET_MISSING`, `OL_E_SPLASH_ASSET_DIRECTORY_MISSING`, `OL_E_SPLASH_FORMAT_UNSUPPORTED`, `OL_E_ITX_PROFILE_REQUIRED`, `OL_E_ITX_PROFILE_MISSING`, `OL_E_ITX_PROFILE_INVALID`, `OL_E_ITX_TARGET_OUTSIDE_TEXTURE_PATH`, `OL_E_UNKNOWN_SETTING`, `OL_E_SETTING_NOT_WRITABLE`, `OL_E_INVALID_SETTING_VALUE`, `OL_E_CLOSECHECK_REMOVE_FAILED`, `OL_E_RECOVERY_BACKUP_CORRUPT`, `OL_E_RECOVERY_ABSENT_OWNERSHIP_MISMATCH`, `OL_E_RECOVERY_ABSENT_OWNERSHIP_UNVERIFIED` (only when the deferred retry with this session's overlays still cannot prove ownership), `OL_E_RECOVERY_JOURNAL_REMOVE_FAILED`, `OL_E_PROCESS_START_FAILED`, `OL_E_PROCESS_CREATION_TIME_FAILED`. Cleanup may add `OL_E_PROCESS_CLEANUP_FAILED`, `OL_E_RESTORE_DEFERRED` (OMSI exit not confirmed; journal retained) or `OL_E_RESTORE_FAILED`. Later failures are reported by the supervisor (see [session lifecycle](../concepts/session-lifecycle.md)). |
| Cancellation | Before/during the re-plan: throws. After that the token is passed to the transaction and process creation; a cancellation there is treated like any start failure (`Failed` + `OL_E_START_SESSION: The operation was canceled.`), the process (if created) is terminated and the installation restored. |
| Running session required | No. |
| Mutates OMSI state | Yes: creates the OMSI process with the environment variables `OMSILAUNCH_SESSION_ID`, `OMSILAUNCH_HANDOFF_NAME`, `OMSILAUNCH_TELEMETRY_NAME`, `OMSILAUNCH_RUNTIME_CHANNEL`, `OMSILAUNCH_INTERNET_TEXTURES_MODE`. |
| Mutates the file system | Yes, inside the installation root: `.omsilaunch\diagnostics\<sessionId>-host.log` (retention: 50 newest sessions), `.omsilaunch\journal.json`, `.omsilaunch\backup\<sessionId>\*.bin`, `.omsilaunch\assets\splash\*.bmp` (copied once for managed splash), session overlays (`options.cfg` patches, `GUI\NewSplashscreen_*.bmp`, `Texture\standard.itx`), session deletions (ITX targets, `Texture\standard.ipr`, `closecheck`), and permanent removal of a pre-existing stale `closecheck` when `SuppressStaleClosecheckWarning` is true (diagnostic `closecheck.stale-removed`). |
| Transaction / restore | Opens the transaction (`Prepared` → `Applied` → `RuntimeDeployed` → `HandoffCreated` → `ProcessStarted`). Every path out of the session ends in restore. See [transactions and recovery](../concepts/transactions-and-recovery.md). |
| Limitations | Only `WorldMode.NewMap` with `PresentedEntrypointIndex` and `WorldMode.SavedSituation` reach gameplay. `WorldMode.LastMapState` is `UNAVAILABLE`. Date/time/weather/player-vehicle/input requests never reach this method because they are non-runnable at plan time. |
| Stability | `STABLE_BETA` (NEW_MAP and SAVED_SITUATION lifecycles are runtime validated). |
| Example | `var session = await launch.StartSessionAsync(plan); var s = await launch.GetStatusAsync(session); if (s.State == SessionState.Failed) Console.WriteLine(s.Diagnostics.Last(d => d.Code.StartsWith("OL_E_")).Message);` |

### `GetStatusAsync`

| Aspect | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Signature | `Task<SessionStatus> GetStatusAsync(SessionHandle session, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)` |
| Purpose | Read the semantic lifecycle state, the diagnostics collected so far and the bounded runtime event list. Public capability `session.status`. |
| Parameters | `session`: a handle returned by `StartSessionAsync` and not yet closed. |
| Returns | `SessionStatus(SessionId, State, Diagnostics, RuntimeEvents)`: an immutable snapshot (arrays are copied under the session lock). `RuntimeEvents` is never `null` for a live session. |
| Thrown | `KeyNotFoundException` for unknown/closed handles. Never throws otherwise. |
| Cancellation | The token is ignored (the call completes synchronously). |
| Running session required | No. |
| Mutates OMSI / file system / transaction | No / No / None. |
| Stability | `STABLE_BETA`. |
| Example | `var status = await launch.GetStatusAsync(session); Console.WriteLine($"{status.State} events={status.RuntimeEvents!.Count}");` |

### `WaitForAsync`

| Aspect | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Signature | `Task<SessionStatus> WaitForAsync(SessionHandle session, SessionState state, TimeSpan timeout, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)` |
| Purpose | Poll (every 100 ms) until the session is in `state`, or in a terminal state (`Completed`, `Failed`), or the timeout elapses; then return the current status. |
| Parameters | `state`: any `SessionState`. Waiting for a transient state that was already passed (or is never set, see [session lifecycle](../concepts/session-lifecycle.md)) waits until a terminal state or the timeout. `timeout`: any non-negative `TimeSpan` or `Timeout.InfiniteTimeSpan`. |
| Returns | The status at the moment the wait ended. On timeout the status is returned, not an exception: check `State` yourself. A wait for `Running` that ends in `Failed` returns immediately with the failure diagnostics. |
| Thrown | `KeyNotFoundException`; `OperationCanceledException` when the caller's token is cancelled (only caller cancellation propagates; the internal timeout does not). |
| Cancellation | Caller token honoured at every 100 ms tick. |
| Running session required | No. |
| Mutates OMSI / file system / transaction | No / No / None. |
| Stability | `STABLE_BETA`. |
| Example | `var running = await launch.WaitForAsync(session, SessionState.Running, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(185)); if (running.State != SessionState.Running) { /* timed out or Failed */ }` |

### `StopAsync`

| Aspect | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Signature | `Task StopAsync(SessionHandle session, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)` |
| Purpose | Request the canonical stop. It sets the stop flag and returns immediately; the supervisor observes the flag within its 100 ms loop, calls `TerminateProcess` on `Omsi.exe`, waits for exit, marks the journal `ProcessExited`, restores every session-owned file and releases the lease. This is a forced termination: OMSI's own shutdown routine does not run and OMSI does not rewrite `options.cfg` on exit (deliberate, protects the transaction). Cooperative `WM_CLOSE` shutdown is not implemented (product decision; in the runtime closure OMSI did not close within 30 s of `WM_CLOSE`, `L05b`). Public capability `session.stop`. |
| Parameters | `session`. |
| Returns | Completed task; does not wait for termination or restore. Use `WaitForAsync(session, SessionState.Completed, ...)` to observe completion. |
| Thrown | `KeyNotFoundException`. |
| Cancellation | Token ignored. |
| Running session required | No. Idempotent; a stop requested before the supervisor starts is honoured as soon as it starts; a stop on a terminal session is a no-op. |
| Mutates OMSI state | Yes: terminates the OMSI process (exit code 1). |
| Mutates the file system | Indirectly: triggers restore, journal deletion and backup removal by the supervisor. |
| Transaction / restore | Triggers `ProcessExited` → `Restoring` → `Restored`. Runtime-side changes made through `ExecuteRuntimeAsync` (clock writes, spawned vehicles, script variables, D3D textures) are not restored; they disappear with the process. |
| Stability | `STABLE_BETA`. |
| Example | `await launch.StopAsync(session); var done = await launch.WaitForAsync(session, SessionState.Completed, TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1));` |

### `CloseAsync`

| Aspect | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Signature | `Task CloseAsync(SessionHandle session, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)` |
| Purpose | Release the consumer handle without stranding the transaction: if the session is not terminal, request the canonical stop; then await the supervisor's lifecycle task (process exit, restore, lease release); then forget the session. |
| Parameters | `session`. |
| Returns | Completes when the session is terminal and removed. After it returns, the handle is unknown (`KeyNotFoundException` on any further call, including a second `CloseAsync`). |
| Thrown | `KeyNotFoundException`; `OperationCanceledException` if the caller cancels while waiting for the supervisor. In that case the session is not removed and the supervisor keeps running; call `CloseAsync` again. |
| Cancellation | Applies only to the wait; it never cancels the restore. |
| Running session required | No. |
| Mutates OMSI state | Yes when the session is still live (same as `StopAsync`). |
| Mutates the file system | Indirectly (restore by the supervisor). |
| Transaction / restore | Guarantees the transaction is driven to completion before the handle is released (when the supervisor was started). For a session that failed before the supervisor started, the start path has already restored or reported `OL_E_RESTORE_DEFERRED`. |
| Stability | `STABLE_BETA`. |
| Example | `try { ... } finally { await launch.CloseAsync(session); }` |

### `ExecuteRuntimeAsync`

| Aspect | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Signature | `Task<RuntimeCommandResult> ExecuteRuntimeAsync(SessionHandle session, RuntimeCommand command, TimeSpan timeout, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)` |
| Purpose | Execute one public runtime operation inside the running OMSI process through the single-flight session mailbox (memory-mapped, 64 KiB, request bound to session id and request id). The plugin executes the operation on OMSI's UI thread. Operation catalogue: [runtime control](runtime-control.md) and [capabilities](capabilities.md). |
| Parameters | `command.SessionId` must equal `session.SessionId`. `command.RequestId`: caller-chosen `ulong`; use a strictly increasing counter per process (the D3D helpers start at 30 000, the CLI owner at 10 001/50 000). `command.Operation`: a public operation id from `PublicCapabilityRegistry.PublicRuntimeOperationIds` (for example `time.read`, `road-vehicle.read`, `d3d.texture.create`). `command.Arguments`: string values keyed by ordinal names; required names per operation come from `PublicCapabilityRegistry.GetRuntimeArguments`. `timeout`: measured from the moment the request is staged in the mailbox (queueing behind another in-flight command is not counted). The CLI uses 5 s (15 s for `road-vehicles.spawn`) as owner and 8 s / 30 s as client. |
| Order of checks | 1. Registry validation (before session lookup): unknown or `internal.*` operation → result `Succeeded=false, ErrorCode=OL_E_RUNTIME_OPERATION_UNKNOWN`; missing required argument (absent or whitespace) → `OL_E_RUNTIME_ARGUMENT_REQUIRED`. 2. Session lookup → `KeyNotFoundException`. 3. `command.SessionId != session.SessionId` → `InvalidOperationException("OL_E_RUNTIME_SESSION_MISMATCH")`. 4. State not `Running` → `InvalidOperationException("OL_E_SESSION_NOT_RUNNING")`. 5. Mailbox request. 6. Result values whose key starts with `internal_` or ends with `_address`, `_pointer`, `_vmt` are stripped. |
| Returns | `RuntimeCommandResult(SessionId, RequestId, Succeeded, ErrorCode, Values)`. On success `Values` holds the operation's semantic strings (documented per operation in [runtime control](runtime-control.md)). |
| Result-carried errors | `OL_E_RUNTIME_OPERATION_UNKNOWN`, `OL_E_RUNTIME_ARGUMENT_REQUIRED` (registry); `OL_E_RUNTIME_RESPONSE_TOO_LARGE` (plugin result exceeded the mailbox; bounded list results are shortened with `truncated=true` instead); `OL_E_RUNTIME_SETTING_NOT_PERSISTENT` (`weather.set`, always); every `OL_E_D3D_*` code (with `Values["detail"]` and `Values["native_status"]`); and `OL_E_RUNTIME_OPERATION_FAILED` for every other plugin-side failure. In that last case the specific code is not in `ErrorCode`: it is the first token of `Values["detail"]` (for example `detail = "OL_E_RUNTIME_OBJECT_HANDLE_STALE"`, `exception = "InvalidOperationException"`). Codes that arrive this way: `OL_E_RUNTIME_OPERATION_UNAVAILABLE`, `OL_E_RUNTIME_ARGUMENT_REQUIRED` (plugin-side checks), `OL_E_RUNTIME_VALUE_OUT_OF_RANGE`, `OL_E_RUNTIME_VALUE_INVALID`, `OL_E_RUNTIME_OBJECT_HANDLE_REQUIRED`, `OL_E_RUNTIME_OBJECT_HANDLE_STALE`, `OL_E_RUNTIME_SCRIPT_OBJECT_UNAVAILABLE`, `OL_E_RUNTIME_VARIABLE_NOT_FOUND`, `OL_E_RUNTIME_VARIABLE_UNAVAILABLE`, `OL_E_RUNTIME_STRING_VARIABLE_NOT_FOUND`, `OL_E_RUNTIME_CONSTANT_NOT_FOUND`, `OL_E_RUNTIME_CONSTANTS_UNAVAILABLE`, `OL_E_RUNTIME_CURVE_NOT_FOUND`, `OL_E_RUNTIME_CURVE_EMPTY`, `OL_E_RUNTIME_CURVE_DEGENERATE`, `OL_E_RUNTIME_CURVE_INVALID`, `OL_E_RUNTIME_HOF_UNAVAILABLE`, `OL_E_RUNTIME_PLAYER_VEHICLE_UNAVAILABLE`, `OL_E_CAMERA_PRESET_FAMILY_UNSUPPORTED`, `OL_E_TIME_APPLY_FAILED`, `OL_E_RUNTIME_BUS_IDENTITY_INVALID`, `OL_E_MAKEVEHICLE_BUS_NOT_FOUND`, `OL_E_MAKEVEHICLE_DELTA_ZERO`, `OL_E_MAKEVEHICLE_DELTA_MULTIPLE`, `OL_E_MAKEVEHICLE_NATIVE_FAILED`, `OL_E_RUNTIME_CREATED_OBJECT_NOT_IN_COLLECTION`, `OL_E_RUNTIME_CREATED_OBJECT_INVALID`, `OL_E_PLACE_RANDOM_BUS_FAILED`, `OL_E_RUNTIME_SETTING_UNAVAILABLE`. See [error codes](errors.md). |
| Thrown | `KeyNotFoundException`; `InvalidOperationException` with `OL_E_RUNTIME_SESSION_MISMATCH`, `OL_E_SESSION_NOT_RUNNING`, `OL_E_RUNTIME_CHANNEL_CLOSED` (mailbox already disposed by the supervisor), `OL_E_RUNTIME_CHANNEL_BUSY` (slot still holds an abandoned request), `OL_E_RUNTIME_REQUEST_ID_REUSED` (a stale response for the same request id is still in the slot); `TimeoutException("OL_E_RUNTIME_REQUEST_TIMEOUT")`; `InvalidDataException("OL_E_RUNTIME_RESPONSE_INVALID")` (corrupt, foreign or mismatched response); `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` when the serialised request exceeds the mailbox; `OperationCanceledException`. |
| Cancellation | Honoured while waiting for the per-session gate and every 20 ms while polling for the response. Cancelling mid-flight does not reset the slot: the next call on that session may fail with `OL_E_RUNTIME_CHANNEL_BUSY` until the plugin publishes its response (which is then discarded as stale). Prefer the timeout; a timeout resets the slot and a late response is detected and discarded. |
| Running session required | Yes (`SessionState.Running`); otherwise `OL_E_SESSION_NOT_RUNNING` is thrown. The mailbox exists until the supervisor disposes it during restore. |
| Mutates OMSI state | Depends on the operation: `Read` operations do not; `Write`/`Action` operations (`time.set`, `camera.set`, `camera.lock`, `camera.unlock`, `road-vehicles.spawn`, `road-vehicles.place-random`, `vehicle.variable.set`, `d3d.texture.*`) mutate in-process state that is not restored. |
| Mutates the file system | No host writes. OMSI may write its own files as a consequence (not tracked). |
| Transaction / restore | None. |
| Limitations | One in-flight command per session (calls on the same session are serialised). Request and response are each limited to 64 KiB minus 8 bytes; D3D pixel payloads to 48 KiB. `internal.road-vehicles.make-basic` is `INTERNAL` and unreachable. `weather.set` is `UNAVAILABLE`. `timetable.logs.read` is not bounded and can return `OL_E_RUNTIME_RESPONSE_TOO_LARGE` on large timetables. `camera.lock` is `EXPERIMENTAL`; it needs a player vehicle and is runtime-validated (`CAM01`), although the registry's `RuntimeValidation` string still reads `STATICALLY_VALIDATED`. Handles (`rv-NNNNNN`, `hb-NNNNNN`, `d3dtex-<session>-<hex>`) are session-scoped. |
| Stability | Transport and contract `STABLE_BETA`; per-operation stability follows `PublicCapabilityRegistry` (`PublicStableBeta` → `STABLE_BETA`, `PublicExperimental` → `EXPERIMENTAL`) with the exceptions above. |
| Example | `var r = await launch.ExecuteRuntimeAsync(session, new RuntimeCommand(session.SessionId, 42, "road-vehicle.read", new Dictionary<string, string> { ["handle"] = "rv-000001" }), TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5)); if (!r.Succeeded) Console.WriteLine($"{r.ErrorCode} {r.Values?["detail"]}");` |

### `GetCapabilitiesAsync`

| Aspect | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Signature | `Task<IReadOnlyList<Capability>> GetCapabilitiesAsync(InstallationSpec installation, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)` |
| Purpose | Return the product's evidence inventory for an installation: a fixed list of `Capability(Name, Available, EvidenceState, Reason)` entries maintained in `OmsiLaunchService`. Only `runtime.current-windows-x64` is computed (from platform detection); every other entry is constant. |
| Parameters | `installation.RootPath`: directory used for the platform probe (writability requires the directory to exist, not to be read-only and to contain `plugins\`). `ExpectedExecutableSha256` is ignored. |
| Returns | 51 entries, for example `runtime.time.read` (`RUNTIME_VALIDATED`), `runtime.weather.write` (`false`, `RUNTIME_PARTIAL`), `world.last-map-state` (`false`, `UNSUPPORTED_FOR_CURRENT_PROFILE`), `world.date.explicit` (`false`, `STATICALLY_PARTIAL`), `content.maps` (`STATICALLY_VALIDATED`), `runtime.d3d.lifecycle.reset` (`IMPLEMENTED_NOT_RUNTIME_VALIDATED`). |
| Difference from `PublicCapabilityRegistry` | `PublicCapabilityRegistry.All` is the compile-time control-surface catalogue (36 descriptors with classification, kind, API and CLI routes, required arguments) that the API and CLI enforce; it does not depend on the installation. `GetCapabilitiesAsync` is a runtime evidence report (validation state and reasons). Use the registry to decide what you may call; use this list to decide what has been proven. Neither list is derived from the other. |
| Thrown | `OperationCanceledException` at entry; `ArgumentException` for an empty root path. |
| Cancellation | Checked once at entry. |
| Running session required | No. |
| Mutates OMSI / file system / transaction | No / No / None. |
| Stability | Call contract `STABLE_BETA`; the list content is a hand-maintained inventory: `PARTIAL`. |
| Example | `foreach (var c in await launch.GetCapabilitiesAsync(new InstallationSpec(root))) Console.WriteLine($"{c.Name} {c.Available} {c.EvidenceState} {c.Reason}");` |

### `DiscoverAsync`

| Aspect | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Signature | `Task<IReadOnlyList<ContentIdentity>> DiscoverAsync(InstallationSpec installation, ContentQueryKind query, OptionalValue<string> scope = default, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)` |
| Purpose | Enumerate installed content and return canonical identities usable in a `LaunchSpec`. Discovery skips reparse points (junction cycles cannot hang it), reads OMSI files as Windows-1252 (BOM-marked UTF-8/UTF-16 respected) and never follows symbolic links. |
| Parameters | `query` and `scope` per the table below. `scope` is required for `Entrypoints` (map identity), `Repaints`, `FleetNumbers`, `Registrations` (vehicle identity). |
| Returns | Sorted `ContentIdentity(Identity, Kind, DisplayName)` list. Identities are installation-relative paths with backslashes; comparisons are case-insensitive. |
| Thrown | `OperationCanceledException` at entry; `ArgumentException` when `Entrypoints` is queried without a scope or the root is empty; `FileNotFoundException` (no `OL_E_` code; the CLI maps it to `OL_E_NOT_FOUND`) when the scope map or vehicle is not installed. A missing root or content directory yields an empty list, not an error. |
| Cancellation | Checked once at entry. |
| Running session required | No. |
| Mutates OMSI / file system / transaction | No / No / None. |
| Stability | `Maps`, `Situations`, `Vehicles`: `STABLE_BETA` (every runtime-validated plan resolves through them). `Entrypoints`, `Repaints`, `Hofs`, `FleetNumbers`, `Registrations`, `Addons`: `EXPERIMENTAL` (static evidence only). |
| Example | `var maps = await launch.DiscoverAsync(new InstallationSpec(root), ContentQueryKind.Maps); var entries = await launch.DiscoverAsync(new InstallationSpec(root), ContentQueryKind.Entrypoints, OptionalValue<string>.Set(maps[0].Identity));` |

`ContentQueryKind` values and results:

| Value | Scope | `Identity` | `Kind` | `DisplayName` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Maps` | none | `maps\<dir>\global.cfg` | `map` | map directory name |
| `Situations` | none | `situations\...\<file>.osn` | `situation` | map identity referenced by the `.osn` (may be `null`) |
| `Vehicles` | none | `Vehicles\...\<file>.bus` | `vehicle` | `[friendlyname]` or file name |
| `Repaints` | vehicle identity (required; without it: empty list) | `<cti path>#item:<ordinal>` | `repaint` | `[item]` name |
| `Hofs` | none | `Vehicles\...\<file>.hof` | `hof` | `null` |
| `FleetNumbers` | vehicle identity (required; without it: empty list) | vehicle-relative `[number]` source path | `fleet-number` | `null` |
| `Registrations` | vehicle identity (required; without it: empty list) | `registration_automatic` / `registration_list` / `registration_free` | `registration` | first value line (`null` for free) |
| `Addons` | none | `Addons\<dir>` | `addon` | `directory-only` |
| `Entrypoints` | map identity (required; without it: `ArgumentException`) | `<map identity>#entrypoint:<SHA-256 of the 12-line record>` | `entrypoint` | entrypoint label |

Entrypoint identities are for discovery only: the launch path uses `PresentedEntrypointIndex`; passing an `EntrypointIdentity` makes the plan non-runnable on this build (`world.entrypoint-identity`, `RUNTIME_PARTIAL`).

### `RecoverPendingAsync`

| Aspect | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Signature | `Task<RecoveryStatus> RecoverPendingAsync(InstallationSpec installation, bool restore, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)` |
| Purpose | Report or complete a stale durable transaction (`<root>\.omsilaunch\journal.json`) left by a crashed owner. Takes the installation lease for the duration of the call so it never restores underneath a starting session. Public capability `session.recover`; CLI `/recovery-status` and `/recover`. |
| Parameters | `installation.RootPath`: the installation root (normalised with `Path.GetFullPath`). `restore`: `false` = report only; `true` = restore, verify, delete the journal and backups. |
| Returns | `RecoveryStatus(Pending, Recovered, Diagnostics)`: `Pending` = a journal existed when the call started; `Recovered` = a restore was requested, ran, and no journal remains; `Diagnostics` = restore notes (`restore.session-artifact-removed` with `Data["sha256"]`, `OL_W_RESTORE_FOREIGN_FILE_RETAINED`), empty when nothing was restored. |
| Thrown | `InvalidOperationException("OL_E_INSTALLATION_BUSY: another OmsiLaunch owner holds this installation.")` when the lease is held; `IOException("OL_E_INSTALLATION_BUSY: a journaled OMSI process is still alive.")` when the journal's PID + creation time + executable path still match a live process, or (journal past `HandoffCreated` without a PID) any `Omsi.exe` from that root is running; `IOException` with `OL_E_RECOVERY_BACKUP_CORRUPT`, `OL_E_RECOVERY_ABSENT_OWNERSHIP_MISMATCH`, `OL_E_RECOVERY_ABSENT_OWNERSHIP_UNVERIFIED`, `OL_E_RECOVERY_JOURNAL_REMOVE_FAILED`, or a verification message ("Restore hash mismatch: ...", "Restore presence mismatch: ..."); `InvalidDataException("Invalid OmsiLaunch journal.")` / `JsonException` for a corrupt journal; `ArgumentException` for an empty root; `OperationCanceledException`. Whenever it throws after a restore started, the journal is retained and the next call replays idempotently. |
| Cancellation | Passed to the journal/backup writes; cancelling mid-restore leaves the journal pending. |
| Running session required | No (it refuses while an owner is active). |
| Mutates OMSI state | No. |
| Mutates the file system | Only with `restore == true`: rewrites originals from verified backups (bytes, last-write time, creation time, attributes; read-only originals handled; write-through + flush; no `*.omsilaunch.tmp` left), removes session artefacts, deletes `journal.json` and `backup\<sessionId>`. |
| Transaction / restore | Completes the pending transaction (`Restoring` → `Restored` → journal removed). |
| Stability | `STABLE_BETA`: report path and early-exit recovery (matrix RV-008), recovery after a failed restore (runtime closure `F01`), refusal under a live owner and in the pre-PID window (`S04`) and deferred pre-fingerprint recovery at start (`S05`); see [runtime validation status](../status/runtime-validation-status.md). |
| Example | `var r = await launch.RecoverPendingAsync(new InstallationSpec(root), restore: true); Console.WriteLine($"pending={r.Pending} recovered={r.Recovered}");` |

## Contract types

### Optional values and semantic primitives

| Type | Definition | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OptionalValue<T>` | `readonly record struct OptionalValue<T>(Presence Presence, T? Value)`; `IsSet`, static `Unset`, static `Set(T)` | Distinguishes "not requested" from "requested with a value". JSON shape is documented in the [LaunchSpec reference](launchspec.md). |
| `Presence` | `Unset` = 0, `Set` = 1 | Byte enum. |
| `SemanticDate` | `(int Year, int Month, int Day)` | Validated only when `DateTimeMode.Explicit` (month 1..12, day 1..31). |
| `SemanticTime` | `(int Hour, int Minute, int Second)` | Validated only when `DateTimeMode.Explicit` (0..23, 0..59, 0..59). |

### LaunchSpec family

All records below are documented property by property in the [LaunchSpec reference](launchspec.md); this table fixes the type inventory.

| Type | Purpose | Stability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LaunchSpec` | Root request record with `EffectiveYear`, `EffectiveWeather`, `EffectiveInput`, `EffectiveDiagnostics`, `EffectivePresentation`, `EffectiveInternetTextures` accessors that substitute defaults for `null` optional members. | `STABLE_BETA` |
| `InstallationSpec` | `RootPath`, `ExpectedExecutableSha256` (carried, not consumed). | `STABLE_BETA` / `PARTIAL` |
| `WorldSpec`, `WorldMode`, `EntrypointSpec`, `EntrypointMode` | World selection. `WorldMode`: `NewMap` = 0, `SavedSituation` = 1, `LastMapState` = 2, `LastSituation` = 2 (obsolete alias of `LastMapState`; never "the newest .osn"). `EntrypointMode`: `Unset`, `PresentedIndex`, `Identity` (computed from `WorldSpec.Entrypoint`). | `NewMap`, `SavedSituation`: `STABLE_BETA`; `LastMapState`: `UNAVAILABLE`; `EntrypointMode.Identity`: `PARTIAL` |
| `DateSpec`, `TimeSpec`, `YearSpec`, `DateTimeMode` | `DateTimeMode`: `Unset`, `Explicit`, `System`. Any mode other than `Unset` makes the plan non-runnable. | `PARTIAL` (`STATICALLY_PARTIAL`) |
| `WeatherSpec`, `WeatherMode` | `WeatherMode`: `Unset`, `Preset`, `Icao`, `RealCurrent`. Any mode other than `Unset` makes the plan non-runnable. | `PARTIAL` |
| `PlayerVehicleSpec` | `Model`, `Repaint`, `Hof`, `FleetNumber`, `Registration`, `Enabled`. Any set field makes the plan non-runnable. | `PARTIAL` |
| `EnvironmentSpec` | Eight `IReadOnlyDictionary<string, OptionalValue<string>>` groups of semantic `options.cfg` settings. | `STABLE_BETA` |
| `InputSpec` | `KeyboardDocument`, `ControllerDocument`; any set value makes the plan non-runnable. | `PARTIAL` |
| `DiagnosticsSpec` | Six booleans; carried, not consumed. | `PARTIAL` |
| `SessionPresentationSpec`, `SplashMode` | `SplashMode`: `Unset` = 0, `Native` = 0 (alias), `Managed` = 1. | `STABLE_BETA` |
| `InternetTexturesSpec`, `InternetTexturesMode` | `InternetTexturesMode`: `Native`, `Disabled`, `Override`. | `STABLE_BETA` (`Native`), `EXPERIMENTAL` (`Disabled`, `Override`) |
| `SessionProfileMetadata` | Provenance of a compiled session profile (`Id`, `Name`, `Version`, `Author`, `PresetId`, `PresetIndex`, `PresetName`, `PackagePath`). | `STABLE_BETA` |
| `LaunchBehaviorSpec` | `RestoreConfiguration` (carried, restore always happens), `SuppressStaleClosecheckWarning`, `StartupTimeoutSeconds` (1..600, default 180), `ShutdownTimeoutSeconds` (carried, not consumed). | `STABLE_BETA` / `PARTIAL` |

### Plan and status types

| Type | Fields | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SessionPlan` | `SessionId` (new `Guid` per plan), `BuildProfileId` (`"Omsi23004_692EBFBF"`), `Spec`, `Platform` (`RuntimePlatformInfo`), `ResolvedContent` (`ContentIdentity` list: `map`, `vehicle`, `repaint`, `hof`, `situation`, `situation-map`), `TouchedFiles` (distinct relative paths of `PlannedMutations`), `RuntimeArtifacts`, `RequiredCapabilities` (`Capability` with `STATICALLY_VALIDATED` or `UNAVAILABLE`), `UnsupportedRequestedFeatures` (`Capability` entries for requested-but-unsupported features), `PlannedMutations`, `Diagnostics`, `IsRunnable`. | A public record: it can be edited or go stale, which is why `StartSessionAsync` re-plans. |
| `RuntimePlatformInfo` | `OsFamily`, `OsVersion`, `OsArchitecture`, `HostArchitecture`, `OmsiArchitecture` (`X86`), `PluginArchitecture` (`X86`), `CurrentPlatformSupported` (Windows 10+, x64 OS and x64 host), `LegacyPlatform` (always `false`), `Wow64Available`, `InstallationWritable`, `ProcessLaunchSupported`, `PluginRuntimeSupported`, `NativeInteropSupported`, `SharedMemorySupported`, `ExactRestoreSupported` (all equal to `CurrentPlatformSupported`). | |
| `Capability` | `Name`, `Available`, `EvidenceState`, `Reason`. | Evidence strings are free text (`RUNTIME_VALIDATED`, `STATICALLY_VALIDATED`, `STATICALLY_PARTIAL`, `RUNTIME_PARTIAL`, `UNAVAILABLE`, `UNSUPPORTED_FOR_CURRENT_PROFILE`, `IMPLEMENTED_NOT_RUNTIME_VALIDATED`, `RELEASE_IF_CLOSED`). |
| `PlannedMutation` | `RelativePath`, `SemanticKey`, `RequestedValue`, `Operation` (`token-patch`, `vector-component-patch`, `exact-file-overlay`). | Presentation mutations use the keys `session-presentation.splash`, `internet-textures.override`, `internet-textures.cache`, `internet-textures.target`. |
| `LaunchDiagnostic` | `Code`, `Message`, `Data` (optional string map). | Codes starting with `OL_E_` are errors, `OL_W_` warnings, anything else informational. |
| `SessionStatus` | `SessionId`, `State` (`SessionState`), `Diagnostics`, `RuntimeEvents`. | Session diagnostics do not include plan diagnostics. |
| `RuntimeEvent` | `Type`, `TimestampUtc` (host receipt time), `Sequence` (1-based, per session), `Data`. | Bounded to the 256 most recent events (oldest dropped). The telemetry slot is latest-value: events emitted faster than the 100 ms host poll can be missed. Not a lossless log. |
| `SessionHandle` | `SessionId`. | Process-local. |
| `RecoveryStatus` | `Pending`, `Recovered`, `Diagnostics`. | See `RecoverPendingAsync`. |
| `ContentIdentity` | `Identity`, `Kind`, `DisplayName`. | See `DiscoverAsync`. |
| `ContentQueryKind` | `Maps`, `Situations`, `Vehicles`, `Repaints`, `Hofs`, `FleetNumbers`, `Registrations`, `Addons`, `Entrypoints`. | |

### `SessionState`

Byte enum in declaration order: `Created`, `ValidatingPlatform`, `Planning`, `AcquiringInstallationLock`, `RecoveringPreviousTransaction`, `Snapshotting`, `ApplyingConfiguration`, `DeployingRuntime`, `CreatingStartupHandoff`, `StartingProcess`, `WaitingForPlugin`, `PluginBootstrap`, `StartingWorld`, `EnteringGameplay`, `Running`, `ProcessExited`, `Restoring`, `CleaningRuntime`, `Completed`, `Failed`. `ValidatingPlatform`, `Planning` and `EnteringGameplay` are never set by the current service; `Snapshotting` is transient and practically unobservable. Terminal states: `Completed`, `Failed`. Full semantics: [session lifecycle](../concepts/session-lifecycle.md).

### Runtime control types

| Type | Definition | Stability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RuntimeCommand` | `(Guid SessionId, ulong RequestId, string Operation, IReadOnlyDictionary<string, string>? Arguments)` | `STABLE_BETA` |
| `RuntimeCommandResult` | `(Guid SessionId, ulong RequestId, bool Succeeded, string? ErrorCode, IReadOnlyDictionary<string, string>? Values)` | `STABLE_BETA` |
| `RuntimeCommandWire` | Static codec used by the host and the plugin for the mailbox envelope: magic `0x4F4C5243` ("OLRC"), version 1, 72-byte little-endian header (magic, version, kind 1 = request / 2 = response, total length, session `Guid`, request id, payload length, SHA-256 of the payload) followed by a UTF-8 JSON payload. `SerializeRequest`, `SerializeResponse`, `TryDeserializeRequest`, `TryDeserializeResponse`, `TryReadRequestId`. | `INTERNAL`: public because both bridge ends share it; not an integration surface; the format may change with the protocol version. |
| `StartupHandoff` | `(Guid SessionId, string BuildProfileId, WorldMode WorldMode, string MapIdentity, int PresentedEntrypointIndex, bool HeadlessStart, bool PlayerVehicleEnabled, DateTimeMode DateMode, DateTimeMode TimeMode, string EntrypointIdentity, string SituationIdentity)` — what the host publishes to the plugin in the memory-mapped file `OmsiLaunch.Handoff.<sessionId>`. | `INTERNAL` |
| `StartupHandoffWire` | Codec: magic `0x4F4C5348`, version 4 (reads 3 and 4), 64-byte header with SHA-256 payload integrity. | `INTERNAL` |

The plugin rejects a handoff (`plugin.request.unsupported` → `OL_E_CAPABILITY_UNAVAILABLE`) unless `WorldMode` is `NewMap` or `SavedSituation`, `HeadlessStart` is true, `PlayerVehicleEnabled` is false, both date/time modes are `Unset`, and a saved situation has a non-empty identity. The planner enforces the same constraints earlier, so a runnable plan never triggers this.

### Capability registry types

| Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `PublicCapabilityRegistry` | `ProtocolVersion` (`"0.1"`), `All` (36 `PublicCapabilityDescriptor` entries), `PublicRuntimeOperationIds` (the 48 concrete operation ids a frontend may forward), `IsPublicRuntimeOperation`, `GetRuntimeArguments`, `ValidateRuntimeArguments` (returns `PublicRuntimeArgumentValidation`), `IsInternalResultKey`. Enforced by `ExecuteRuntimeAsync`, the CLI and the local control plane. |
| `PublicCapabilityDescriptor` | `Id`, `Family`, `Classification`, `Kind`, `RequiresSession`, `RequiresExactProfile`, `ApiRoute`, `CliRoute`, `RuntimeValidation`, `Description`, `HandleTypes`. |
| `PublicCapabilityClassification` | `PublicStableBeta`, `PublicExperimental`, `InternalOnly`, `Unsupported`. |
| `PublicCapabilityKind` | `Read`, `Write`, `Action`, `Event`. |
| `PublicRuntimeArgumentDescriptor` | `Name`, `Required`, `Description`. |
| `PublicRuntimeArgumentValidation` | `Accepted`, `ErrorCode`, `Message`. |

Full catalogue: [capabilities](capabilities.md).

### `D3DRuntimeApi` extension methods

Typed wrappers over `ExecuteRuntimeAsync` for the `d3d.*` operations (`EXPERIMENTAL`, `PublicExperimental` capability `d3d.texture`). They allocate request ids from a process-wide counter starting at 30 000 and default the timeout to 5 s (except `GetD3DStatusAsync`, which requires one).

| Method | Operation | Arguments and limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GetD3DStatusAsync(IOmsiLaunch, SessionHandle, TimeSpan timeout, CancellationToken)` → `D3DDeviceStatus` | `d3d.status` | none |
| `CreateD3DTextureAsync(..., uint width, uint height, D3DTextureFormat format, uint levels = 1, TimeSpan? timeout, ...)` → `D3DTextureDescription` | `d3d.texture.create` | width/height 1..4096, levels 0..16 |
| `DescribeD3DTextureAsync(..., D3DTextureHandle handle, uint level = 0, ...)` | `d3d.texture.describe` | level 0..15 |
| `UpdateD3DTextureAsync(..., D3DTextureHandle handle, D3DTextureUpdate update, ...)` | `d3d.texture.update` | `D3DTextureUpdate(Level, X, Y, Width, Height, Pixels)`: x/y 0..4095, width/height 1..4096, pixels ≤ 48 KiB (Base64-encoded on the wire) |
| `ReleaseD3DTextureAsync(..., D3DTextureHandle handle, ...)` | `d3d.texture.release` | repeated release is rejected with `OL_E_D3D_RESOURCE_RELEASED` |

Types: `D3DDeviceStatus(Available, State, Generation, LiveTextureCount, ResetHookInstalled, ExecutionThreadId, LastResetThreadId, QueryInterfaceHResult, CooperativeLevelHResult, OwnedDeviceReferences)`; `D3DDeviceState`: `NotReady`, `Ready`, `Lost`, `Resetting`, `Stopping`, `Stopped`; `D3DTextureHandle(Value)` with `Value = "d3dtex-<session id N>-<16 hex>"`; `D3DTextureDescription(Handle, State, DeviceState, Generation, Width, Height, Format, Levels, Level, LevelWidth, LevelHeight, HResult, ExecutionThreadId)`; `D3DTextureResourceState`: `Live`, `Released`, `Stale`; `D3DTextureFormat`: `A8R8G8B8`, `X8R8G8B8`, `R5G6B5`, `X1R5G5B5`, `A1R5G5B5`, `A4R4G4B4`, `A8`, `L8`, `A8L8`.

Errors: a failed result is rethrown as `OmsiRuntimeException(Code, detail)` where `Code` is the result's `ErrorCode` (or `OL_E_RUNTIME_OPERATION_FAILED` when absent) and the message is `"<code>: <Values["detail"]>"`; a successful result without values, or an unknown device-state string, throws `OmsiRuntimeException("OL_E_RUNTIME_PROTOCOL_MISMATCH", ...)`. Everything `ExecuteRuntimeAsync` throws propagates unchanged. Device reset handling is runtime-validated: a reset moves the device through `Resetting` back to `Ready` and invalidates every live texture (`OL_E_D3D_STALE_RESOURCE_HANDLE`, runtime closure `D01`); `GetCapabilitiesAsync` still reports `runtime.d3d.lifecycle.reset` as `IMPLEMENTED_NOT_RUNTIME_VALIDATED` (self-report lag). The `Lost` transition cannot be produced from outside the product and is covered offline only.

```csharp
var status = await launch.GetD3DStatusAsync(session, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));
if (status.State == D3DDeviceState.Ready)
{
    var texture = await launch.CreateD3DTextureAsync(session, 8, 8, D3DTextureFormat.A8R8G8B8);
    var pixels = new byte[8 * 8 * 4];
    await launch.UpdateD3DTextureAsync(session, texture.Handle, new D3DTextureUpdate(0, 0, 0, 8, 8, pixels));
    await launch.ReleaseD3DTextureAsync(session, texture.Handle);
}
```

### Process contract types

| Type | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `PublicExitCode` | `Success` = 0, `SessionFailed` = 1, `InvalidArguments` = 2, `UnsupportedProfile` = 3, `NoActiveSession` = 4, `RuntimeUnavailable` = 5, `NotFound` = 6, `OperationRejected` = 7, `TransactionRecoveryFailed` = 8, `InternalError` = 10. Used by the CLI only ([exit codes](exit-codes.md)); the API never exits the process. |
| `PublicErrorCategory` | String constants used in CLI/control error envelopes: `invalid_argument`, `unsupported_profile`, `session`, `runtime`, `not_found`, `transaction`, `internal`. |
| `PublicErrorCodes` | One `const string` per code (143: 142 `OL_E_` errors and 1 `OL_W_` warning) and `All`, the `PublicErrorDescriptor(Code, Category)` catalogue. Categories: `Cli`, `Compatibility`, `Content`, `Installation`, `InvalidArgument`, `LaunchSpec`, `LocalControl`, `Other`, `Presentation`, `Process`, `Runtime`, `RuntimeD3D`, `Session`, `SessionProfile`, `Transaction`, `Warning`. Reference: [error codes](errors.md). |
| `PublicErrorDescriptor` | `(string Code, string Category)`. |
| `OmsiRuntimeException` | `Code` property plus message; thrown only by `D3DRuntimeApi`. |

### `InstallationPaths` (installation identity and path containment)

Stability: `STABLE_BETA` (pure functions, no I/O, no OMSI state, no filesystem mutation, no transaction participation, no Running session required). It is the single definition used by the installation lease, the local control pipe name, session-profile asset confinement, Internet Textures target validation and the runtime spawn model path.

| Member | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `string NormalizeRoot(string root)` | `Path.GetFullPath(root)` without trailing separators, except a drive root (`C:\`) which is kept. Resolves `.` and `..` segments, treats `/` and `\` alike and collapses repeated separators. Does **not** resolve junctions or symbolic links. Throws `ArgumentException` for a null or blank root. |
| `string IdentityKey(string root)` | Upper-cased `NormalizeRoot(root)`. Lexically equivalent spellings of one root (`C:\OMSI`, `C:\OMSI\`, `C:\OMSI\.`, `C:\foo\..\OMSI`, `c:\omsi`) share one key; different roots (`C:\OMSI-A`, `C:\OMSI-B`) never do. |
| `bool TryGetContainedRelativePath(string root, string candidate, out string relativePath)` | Resolves `candidate` (relative to `root`, or absolute) and returns `true` only when it lies strictly below `root`; `relativePath` is the canonical spelling with `\`. Uses `Path.GetRelativePath` segments, so a sibling such as `C:\OMSI-A\x` is never inside `C:\OMSI`; the root itself, other volumes and `..` escapes return `false`. |
| `IReadOnlyList<string> Segments(string relativePath)` | Splits on `/` and `\`, dropping empty segments. |

```csharp
var same = InstallationPaths.IdentityKey(@"C:\OMSI") == InstallationPaths.IdentityKey(@"c:\foo\..\OMSI\"); // true
InstallationPaths.TryGetContainedRelativePath(@"C:\OMSI", @"Sceneryobjects\\x\texture\a.tga", out var relative); // true, "Sceneryobjects\x\texture\a.tga"
```

### Session profiles (`OmsiLaunch.Core`)

Stability: `EXPERIMENTAL`. These types compile a YAML [session profile](session-profiles.md) (`<root>\.omsilaunch\session-profiles\<id>\profile.yaml`, schema `omsilaunch.session-profile/v1`) into a `LaunchSpec`. The CLI `/predefined-profile:<id> /predefined-profile-index:<n>` uses exactly these calls; an integrator can use them to start a profile through the API.

| `SessionProfileCompiler.Load(string installationRoot, string id, int presetIndex)` → `SessionProfilePackage` | Reads and validates the package. `id` must be a plain directory name (`OL_E_SESSION_PROFILE_PATH_ESCAPE` otherwise); `presetIndex` is 1..5 (`OL_E_SESSION_PROFILE_PRESET_NOT_FOUND`). Missing file: `OL_E_SESSION_PROFILE_NOT_FOUND`; larger than `MaxBytes` (256 KiB), invalid YAML, anchors, unknown keys or an `id` that differs from the directory name: `OL_E_SESSION_PROFILE_INVALID`; other `schema`: `OL_E_SESSION_PROFILE_SCHEMA_UNSUPPORTED`. Asset paths are confined to the package (`OL_E_SESSION_PROFILE_PATH_ESCAPE`, `OL_E_SESSION_PROFILE_ASSET_MISSING`). Every failure is a `SessionProfileException`. |
| `SessionProfileCompiler.Apply(SessionProfilePackage profile, LaunchSpec baseline, WorldMode selectedWorldMode)` → `LaunchSpec` | Returns `baseline` with the profile applied: for `NewMap` the profile's `new` block (map, entrypoint, and any date/time/year/weather, which make the plan non-runnable on this build); the preset's `settings` merged over `Environment.General`; the preset's `Presentation`, `InternetTextures` and `Behavior` when present; and `SessionProfile` = `profile.Metadata`. For `NewMap` it also checks the map against the profile's `compatibility` list (`OL_E_SESSION_PROFILE_MAP_MISMATCH`). |
| `SessionProfileCompiler.ValidateCompatibility(SessionProfilePackage, string installationRoot, WorldSpec world, WorldMode mode)` | The compatibility check for the other modes (for `SavedSituation` the map is read from the `.osn`). The CLI calls it after the final `WorldSpec` is built. |
| `SessionProfileCompiler.Schema`, `MaxBytes`, `SchemaKeys` | `"omsilaunch.session-profile/v1"`, `262144`, and the accepted keys per YAML mapping. |
| `SessionProfilePackage(RootPath, Metadata, CompatibleMaps, New, Preset)`, `ProfileNew`, `ProfilePreset` | The loaded package; `Preset` is the selected preset only. |
| `SessionProfileException(string code, string message)` | `IOException` with `Code` (one of the `OL_E_SESSION_PROFILE_*` codes); the message is `"<code>: <message>"`. |

The CLI additionally rejects command-line flags that conflict with the profile (`OL_E_SESSION_PROFILE_OVERRIDE_CONFLICT`); that check is not part of the compiler. See [session profiles](session-profiles.md#precedence-and-override-conflicts) for the full merge order.

```csharp
static async Task<SessionPlan> PlanProfileAsync(IOmsiLaunch launch, LaunchSpec baseline, string installationRoot, string profileId)
{
    // baseline: a LaunchSpec for installationRoot with World.Mode = WorldMode.NewMap (see the complete example).
    var profile = SessionProfileCompiler.Load(installationRoot, profileId, presetIndex: 1);
    var spec = SessionProfileCompiler.Apply(profile, baseline, WorldMode.NewMap);
    return await launch.PlanSessionAsync(spec); // plan.Spec.SessionProfile carries the provenance
}
```

### Platform types (`OmsiLaunch.Process`)

| Type | Stability | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `IRuntimePlatform` | `STABLE_BETA` as the constructor parameter type of `OmsiLaunchService` | Detects the platform, checks writability, starts, observes, terminates and waits for `Omsi.exe`. Pass `new CurrentWindowsX64Platform()`; implementing it yourself is not supported. |
| `CurrentWindowsX64Platform` | `STABLE_BETA` | The only implementation: Windows x64 host, `CreateProcessW` for `Omsi.exe`, `TerminateProcess` for the canonical stop. Its methods are called by the service; integrators only construct it. Members (shared with `IRuntimePlatform`): `Detect(root)` returns the `RuntimePlatformInfo` of the plan; `ValidateCurrent(info)` throws `OL_E_UNSUPPORTED_OPERATING_SYSTEM` / `OL_E_UNSUPPORTED_OS_ARCHITECTURE` / `OL_E_PLATFORM_CAPABILITY_MISSING` when the host cannot run a session; `IsInstallationWritable(root)` backs `OL_E_INSTALLATION_NOT_WRITABLE`; `StartAsync(request, sha256)` creates `Omsi.exe` and records the process identity (PID, creation time, path and the hash computed by the service; `OL_E_PROCESS_START_FAILED`, `OL_E_PROCESS_CREATION_TIME_FAILED`); `HasExited`, `WaitForExitAsync` and `Terminate` observe and end it. |
| `InstallationLease`, `LaunchedProcess`, `ProcessIdentity`, `ReleaseManifest`, `RuntimeArtifact`, `RuntimeArtifactSet`, `StartupProcessRequest`, `CurrentRuntimeCommandStore`, `IOmsiProcessController`, `OmsiProcessState` | `INTERNAL` | Public in the assembly because the service and the tests share them. Not an integration surface; `LaunchedProcess` wraps the OMSI process and thread handles internally (they are not public members) and is never returned by `IOmsiLaunch`. |

## Thread safety

- `OmsiLaunchService` is safe for concurrent calls on different sessions: sessions live in a `ConcurrentDictionary` and every per-session mutation happens under the session's private lock.
- Concurrent calls on the same session are safe but serialised where it matters: `ExecuteRuntimeAsync` takes a per-session gate, so a second command waits for the first (its timeout starts when it is staged).
- The supervisor runs on a thread-pool task (`Task.Run`) from the moment `StartSessionAsync` returns until the session is terminal; it polls telemetry and the process every 100 ms. Callers never run supervisor code.
- `StopAsync` and `GetStatusAsync` complete synchronously and may be called from any thread, including inside a `ProcessExit` handler (the CLI does this with a 4 s budget).
- No API call is thread-affine; none requires a synchronisation context.

## What is not in the API

- No `IntPtr`, `nint`, Win32 handles, native addresses, VMT pointers or process objects. Result values whose keys start with `internal_` or end with `_address`, `_pointer`, `_vmt` are removed before a result leaves `ExecuteRuntimeAsync`.
- No `internal.*` runtime operations: `internal.road-vehicles.make-basic` is `InternalOnly` in the registry and returns `OL_E_RUNTIME_OPERATION_UNKNOWN` from the API and the CLI.
- No raw OMSI memory reads or writes, no file-level access to the installation other than what a `LaunchSpec` declares.
- No cross-process handles: the [local control plane](local-control.md) is the only cross-process route, and it accepts `session.status`, `session.events`, `session.stop` and `runtime.execute` only.
- No cooperative OMSI shutdown, no `LAST_MAP_STATE`, no date/time/weather/player-vehicle application, no keyboard/controller document overlays on this build.
