# Runtime Capabilities

Status: IMPLEMENTATION INVENTORY (the normative, gate-checked catalog is
[`docs/reference/capabilities.md`](docs/reference/capabilities.md); the
authoritative list of public operation ids is
`PublicCapabilityRegistry.PublicRuntimeOperationIds`)

Runtime evidence in this table was recorded before and during the beta3
hardening round; rows updated after the runtime closure round cite its ids.
A row marked STATICALLY_VALIDATED here may have later runtime evidence; the
authoritative per-item state is
[`docs/status/runtime-validation-status.md`](docs/status/runtime-validation-status.md).

| Capability | API/channel | Interop | Static evidence | Runtime evidence | Release state |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Session request/response | `ExecuteRuntimeAsync` | profile-independent mailbox | protocol and plugin tests | canonical batch PASS | RUNTIME_PASS |
| Stale-response protection | same mailbox | host-side request/response identity check | `runtime-command.late-response-ignored`: a response arriving after the host timeout is discarded and the next request is staged normally | not run | STATICALLY_VALIDATED |
| Public API boundary | `ExecuteRuntimeAsync` | `PublicCapabilityRegistry` | `api.runtime-rejects-internal-operations`: `internal.*` and unknown operations return `OL_E_RUNTIME_OPERATION_UNKNOWN` before session lookup; missing arguments `OL_E_RUNTIME_ARGUMENT_REQUIRED`; `internal_*`, `*_address`, `*_pointer`, `*_vmt` result keys stripped | not run | STATICALLY_VALIDATED |
| Session stop | `session.stop`, `StopAsync`, `CloseAsync`, tray, Ctrl+C | supervisor `TerminateProcess` | forced termination; OMSI shutdown routine does not run; `closecheck` handled as a session deletion | canonical sessions completed requested stop and exact restore | RUNTIME_PASS |
| Time read | `time.read` | `OmsiTimeAdapter` | pinned OmsiHook plus exact profile | PASS | RUNTIME_PASS |
| Map read | `map.read` | `OmsiRuntimeReaders` | pinned `OmsiMap` layout and corrected `OmsiGlobals.Map` slot | PASS in matrix RV-001 (session `e5454061-d0cb-494f-b5ee-f4c2e3876d92`): Grundorf identity, 19 loaded tiles, plausible metadata. `IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md` still records revalidation as required because the earlier wrong-slot read was structurally invalid; the discrepancy is documented, not resolved | RUNTIME_PASS (revalidation requested) |
| Map/tile graph | none | profile trial retained internally | upstream labels `OmsiMap+0x118` as `Kacheln`, but Current live memory did not expose a valid Delphi array header | `map.tiles.list` trial failed safely in sessions `ec85b51a-f69a-4f05-8fb3-638c63f9f20d`, `129482a4-b3a2-448a-830e-4043d11de246`, and `90011081-f5e9-4b31-b907-941bb3a9fd1a`; all cleaned normally | BLOCKED_PROFILE_LAYOUT |

| Clock mutation | `time.set` | `OmsiTimeAdapter` + profiled `SetTime` | upstream clock fields and native call | PASS: minute `17 -> 18 -> 17` | RUNTIME_PASS |
| Scalar weather mutation | `weather.set` | withheld pending native apply lifecycle | derived and `ActWeather` wind candidates are profiled | FAIL: both candidates are overwritten by the next normal OMSI weather tick; requests are rejected with `OL_E_RUNTIME_SETTING_NOT_PERSISTENT` | UNAVAILABLE |
| Semantic presented entrypoint | gated | native `Tform_setpos` exact unique list match | profiled `FormShow`, list-item text and `Button1Click` flow | Partial: canonical run proved `presented index 1 -> raw index 0 -> Nordspitze Bauernhof`; the presented text representation remains unresolved and raw labels are duplicated | RUNTIME_PARTIAL |
| Saved situation startup | `WorldMode.SavedSituation` | profiled Start-form mode/selector/Button1Click sequence | `Tform_start+0x3E4/+0x3F8/+0x434/+0x438/+0x43C`, native `SetChecked`, VMT item-index setter, and `Button1Click` | PASS: `situations\\Baustelle Falkenseer Ch..osn` loaded Berlin-Spandau, reached `gameplay.entered`, remained RUNNING for 8 s, then completed requested stop and normal restore | RUNTIME_PASS |
| Calendar / actual ICAO mutation | none | Delphi string/ABI boundary incomplete | method/profile references | not run | RELEASE_IF_CLOSED |

| Road vehicle / human handle lifetime | opaque `rv-NNNNNN` / `hb-NNNNNN` tokens | generation-scoped collection registry with object fingerprint (VMT plus definition/model index) | `interop.handle-reuse-rejected`: stable snapshot, stale rejection as `OL_E_RUNTIME_OBJECT_HANDLE_STALE`, native-address reuse with and without an intervening list read; residual blind spot is same class and model recreated at the same address between two list reads | Runtime revalidation pending | STATICALLY_VALIDATED |
| Vehicle script variable read | `vehicle.variables.list`, `vehicle.variable.get` | profiled ANSI name table and public-value pointer array | pinned `OmsiComplMapObjInst.GetVariable` chain; profile uses instance `+0x23C` values | PASS: 1,025 names enumerated; `Refresh_Strings=0` | RUNTIME_PASS |

| Spawn basic road vehicle | `road-vehicles.spawn` | profiled MakeVehicle bridge | exact one-object collection delta and profiled VMT validation | PASS: public external route remained responsive during native call; count `2 -> 3`, opaque `rv-000003` resolved across repeated reads | RUNTIME_PASS |
| Camera family/preset lock | `camera.lock`, `camera.unlock` | session-scoped in-process policy | current-profile family selector and active driver/passenger preset offsets | PASS: runtime closure `CAM01`, families 0, 2 and 1 with read-back, then unlock (needs a PlayerVehicle) | RUNTIME_VALIDATED |

## Wave D State

OmsiLaunch owns the D3D9 implementation. It reads the profile-specific device
slot, retains exactly one `QueryInterface<IDirect3DDevice9>` reference, runs
commands through the existing OMSI UI/main/render-owner timer, and exposes no
COM pointer. Default-pool textures are invalidated before observed Reset and
old generations never retarget a replacement resource. Normal texture work,
StopSession, forced exit, relaunch and stale-session rejection are runtime
proven. Two OMSI-driven device resets (runtime closure `D01`, produced by a
test-only display-mode change; no synthetic Reset was invoked) proved the
resetting/restored transitions, generation advance, `OL_E_D3D_RESET_IN_PROGRESS`
during the reset and stale-handle rejection afterwards. A distinct device-loss
transition was not produced (OMSI went straight to `DEVICENOTRESET`).

Unannounced operations are rejected; capability discovery must not imply that a
raw address is safe to write or call.
